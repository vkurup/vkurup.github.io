      <description>I set up an OBi110 device to provide a landline at home. OK, it&amp;rsquo;s not a land line, it&amp;rsquo;s a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) line, but it performs a similar function. We&amp;rsquo;ve always had a landline. Our cell phone coverage is spotty at times and ever since Mala started working from home, she needs to have a reliable phone line for her global conference calls.
The problem is that Spectrum was charging us $44.</description>
