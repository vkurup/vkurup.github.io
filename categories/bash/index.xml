      <description>pyenv is awesome and has changed the way that I manage my Python environments. One tiny annoyance is that it takes a looong time to install each Python version, which of course makes sense, since it has to download and compile each version on your machine. But it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal, since you generally just do this once and then not again until you really need to upgrade to a different Python version.</description>
