      <description>Old people can build muscle. Sorry, this one is behind a paywall, but it basically describes a study that showed that muscle SFI decreased in old people (ages 60-79) with resistance training. Muscle SFI (shape factor index) represents how close the cross-sectional shape of your muscle is to the shape of a circle, where 1.00 is a circle and the lower the number, the better it is. I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of that metric before.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find things on the web as well as I used to. I blame Google being enshittified, but whatever the reason, I&amp;rsquo;m going to post links here. Not sure of the tempo or format but I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll figure that out.
  Lydiard Lacing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having trouble with my toes and someone mentioned that changing my lacing might help. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Lydiard Lacing for a few weeks and it gives my toes a lot more room.</description>
