      <description>After writing yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post about how Mala and I have been losing so much weight over the past 8 months, I thought I should post a small sampling of the food that Mala has made for us in that time. Yes, I am a lucky, lucky man.

      <description>Dear patients,
 Why We Get Fat  I am sorry. I have been giving you bad dietary advice. In medical school we learned that fat in your diet causes fat to accumulate in your arteries, causing heart attacks and strokes, so I told you to eat a low fat diet. Of course, looking back, we had no evidence to support that conclusion, but it just seemed rather obvious. Obvious ideas are often the most dangerous ideas of all.</description>
