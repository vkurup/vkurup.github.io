      <description>The problem The USB-C cord kept falling out of my Android phone. It started happening in the car. A little bump while driving would make the cord fall out. Then it started happening even when I just had it plugged in on a table. I&amp;rsquo;d come down in the morning and the charge would be drained because it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been fully plugged in. Finally, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get it to charge unless I plugged it in forcefully, and put a book under the cord at a certain angle to keep it plugged in.</description>
