      <description>pyenv is awesome and has changed the way that I manage my Python environments. One tiny annoyance is that it takes a looong time to install each Python version, which of course makes sense, since it has to download and compile each version on your machine. But it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal, since you generally just do this once and then not again until you really need to upgrade to a different Python version.</description>

I was honored to to give my &amp;ldquo;Emacs for Python Programming&amp;rdquo; talk at the inaugural PyCarolinas conference. The conference was a huge success in every way, thanks to the efforts of Calvin Spealman, et. al. I promised that I would post my Emacs setup, so here it is.

      <description>If you asked me a few years ago, I would have said you absolutely can&amp;rsquo;t time the stock market. The 2008 crash hurt enough to make me review my convictions a little. I still believe that accurate market timing is somewhere between difficult and impossible. Trying to analyze stock charts to figure out what will happen in the short term is mostly a crap shoot. The way to win in the stock market is to buy value stocks, especially when everyone else is selling.</description>
