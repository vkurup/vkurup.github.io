      <description>Badgertronics.com, borkware.com, and company went through the same ordeal that kurup.org did and MarkD has promptly published his new backup strategy. He uses rsync over SSH which, interestingly enough, is the same strategy that I came up with. Great minds must think alike.
The canonical standard for doing backups on UNIX systems is tar (short for tape archive). tar converts directories of files into a single tar archive file which you would then spit to an attached tape drive.</description>

      <description>Bad news! My Powerbook G3 went kaput yesterday. After a day or so of troubleshooting, I&amp;rsquo;m blaming it on a dead Power Management Unit. I bought it used in 1999 and have been using it heavily since. It&amp;rsquo;s lived in 7 apartments with me (yup, 7!) from Boston to Green Bay to Minneapolis to Boston (again!) and now to NYC. I still think that 4-5 years is way too short a lifespan for a computer, especially since it was meeting my needs in every other way.</description>
