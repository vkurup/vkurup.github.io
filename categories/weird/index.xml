      <description>Clocky, an alarm clock that runs and hides, so you can&amp;rsquo;t hit snooze.&#xA;Comments from old site Just a suggestion&#xA;Why don&#39;t you try putting your alarm clock on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. Instead of something that looks like a cat coughed it up. Andy Drout 2005-04-04 21:25:49 </description>

In late 2007 we are launching a website where people like yourself can upload their Christmas decorated houses. If there is enough interest it may later evolve to a contest.</description>
