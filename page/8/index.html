  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Thanks to Mala&rsquo;s inspiration, I&rsquo;ve been running a lot more over the
past month. Whenever I get into a good running rhythm, my mind starts
to relax and I occasionally get bright ideas (believe it or
not!). While I am running, these always seem Nobel Prize-worthy, but
they seem to lose some of their glitter when the endorphins wear
off. I still believe we could solve all the world&rsquo;s problems if
everyone was a runner.</p>
<p>On a recent run, I was thinking about how Einstein said that compound
interest is the most powerful force in the universe. (<a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/interest.asp">Turns out he probably didn&rsquo;t say that</a>, but let&rsquo;s
pretend someone did.) It occurred
to me that really, it&rsquo;s <em>time</em> that is the most powerful
force. Compound interest is a function of time and possibly may be the
most efficient way to turn time into money, but <em>time</em> is what makes
compound interest powerful. Compound interest over the course of 10
days isn&rsquo;t very powerful. Any activity repeated over a long period of
time can be a powerful force, even if each individual activity doesn&rsquo;t
accomplish much.</p>
<p>Spending a few minutes a day over the past few weeks
has made a significant difference in my life. I&rsquo;ve started a <strong>Habit</strong>
spreadsheet to track some habits, specifically, brushing my teeth at
night (wanted to start with something easy), writing, pushups,
running and meditation. Each day&rsquo;s activity is miniscule, sometimes to
the point of seeming pointless, but over just a few weeks, I&rsquo;ve seen
tangible benefits. I&rsquo;m writing more and therefore learning more about
myself. Sure, I&rsquo;ve also written some really bad stuff, but I know if I
continue these sessions, my life will improve because I will know more
about what I really want out of life. That small amount of time,
compounded over days, weeks and years will make such a huge
difference. The kind of difference where, in a year from now, I&rsquo;ll be
able to describe it better than &ldquo;such a huge difference&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I am probably in better shape than I&rsquo;ve been in since college because
I&rsquo;m running, doing push-ups and playing more with the kids. I ran 40
miles last week, which I haven&rsquo;t done since my marathon training
days. It felt easy and most importantly it&rsquo;s been giving my mind some
time to relax (and generate blog posts like this!) Finally, I&rsquo;m
meditating daily and while that has felt like the least useful of the
new habits I&rsquo;m forming, it is the habit that I think has the most
overall potential to improve my life. Having more control over my
thoughts and my mind will have positive implications for all parts of
my life. My mind has just been very hard to settle down during my
sessions so far. (Any tips for a beginning meditator would be
appreciated!)</p>
<p>I also started working on my website again and I found that I was able
to pick up commands and bits of knowledge that I thought I had
forgotten. Little pieces of web scripting and SQL just seemed to come
back to me even though I haven&rsquo;t actively used them in a couple
years. Since I had put in so much time learning them before, I picked
them up with much less effort now. Same with running. I find it
impossible to run on days that I am working, so I have to wait for my
&ldquo;stretches off&rdquo; to run. It used to be really hard to get to a decent
level when I had taken time off, but now I can take a week off and
still run 5 miles without feeling bad. Maybe that&rsquo;s because I <a href="/blog/2009/09/22/running-slow/">run so slow</a>.</p>
<p>When I think about the huge benefit I&rsquo;ve gotten in a few weeks with
such a small amount of daily commitments, I just can&rsquo;t wait to see
what will happen in a few years! Thinking that far in the future used
to seem ridiculous because I always wanted results <strong>now</strong>, but the
older I get, the more I&rsquo;m willing to wait. Paradoxically, stretching
out my time-frame for results makes it more likely that I will see
results sooner. When I was always trying to make things happen
<strong>now</strong>, I would ignore the little self-improvement things in the name
of efficiency. Now that I take the time to do those things, the
benefits compound with time and I may end up seeing results even on
the things that have nothing directly to do with the habits I&rsquo;m
performing daily.</p>
<p>I also thought about how I&rsquo;ve been trying to simplify my life and I
wonder whether it was worth it. As a general rule, simplifying is a
great idea. Try to drive less, spend less, eat less. Those are all
good things. But I also found that I limited the time that I spent
developing my website. I moved it from <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a>
to a static template solution. There were steps in between, but each
step since leaving OpenACS has been in the name of
simplification. OpenACS (like all active free-software projects) was
changing and I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with it while also being a dad and a
doctor, so I thought it would be better to outsource
(<a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>) or simplify
(<a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>/<a href="http://blogofile.com">Blogofile</a>). While
that seems to make sense, it also means that I&rsquo;ve spent less time on
my website and one of the joys of my life became smaller. So, I am
going to take a more active role in improving my website because I
love doing it. I&rsquo;m not going back to OpenACS, because I do think it
was more complex than I needed. I&rsquo;ve reimplemented google analytics
and adsense because watching those numbers gave me some satisfaction.</p>
<p>Final thought for the day. I&rsquo;ve gotten so much accomplished over the
past few weeks because I&rsquo;ve become more physically and mentally
active. I used fatherhood as an excuse to avoid running and self
improvement. I said I didn&rsquo;t have time for it. That lack of activity
just reflects poorly on everything else in life. I know that&rsquo;s too
dramatic, because life truly has been good for all of us. But, I guess
my lesson to new parents would be to make time for exercise and
self-improvement. It will make you a better parent.</p>
<p>Lessons from this run:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time is the most powerful force in the universe; using it to do
meaningful things is <strong>never</strong> a waste.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t simplify things that you enjoy doing!</li>
<li>Take care of yourself first.</li>
</ol>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>The time comes in every man&rsquo;s life where he eventually has to break
down and buy a minivan. That time has come. The <a href="/blog/2011/02/04/i-retract-my-previous-tweet">Altima is on it&rsquo;s last legs</a> and we really
need a vehicle which can seat our whole family plus a couple visitors
plus luggage. Only a minivan fits those requirements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably wait until the spring to buy. That&rsquo;s when the annual
Consumer Reports auto issue comes out. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m doing some
preliminary research. The Honda Odyssey seems to get the best reviews,
but it&rsquo;s also the most expensive. The Toyota Sienna isn&rsquo;t far behind
on reviews (or on price) and is the only one that comes with AWD. If
the controls on the Sienna are similar to our current RAV4, then that
would simplify life. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m not happy that our RAV4
alternator died just a month out of it&rsquo;s warranty. The Kia Sedona gets
decent reviews and is <strong>much</strong> cheaper, but at the expense of
questionable reliability and poor resale value (which might make it
worthwhile to buy gently used). Finally, the dark horse is the
Mazda5. It was the top rated minivan by Consumer Reports last year
though I hardly ever see one on the roads. It is significantly smaller
than the others, but it&rsquo;s cheaper and gets much better
mileage. Reviews claim it can seat 7 adults without too much
squeezing. We&rsquo;ll have to test drive each of them, but I would <em>love</em>
it if the Mazda5 fit our requirements.</p>
<p>Philip Greenspun recently posted an <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/cars/honda-odyssey-review">entertaining review of the 2011 Honda Odyssey</a>. It&rsquo;s
a favorable review, but includes quite a few bits of Greenspun&rsquo;s
biting humor. My favorite was this comment about the lack of progress
in automotive technology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that you&rsquo;re a sleep-deprived mother. Your infant is sleeping in the middle row of seats and you&rsquo;ve forgotten all about him. You go into a store and leave him to bake in the Odyssey&rsquo;s greenhouse of glass. The child starts to cry. The Odyssey has a sensitive microphone as part of its telephone Bluetooth interface. The Odyssey&rsquo;s computer system is always on, waiting for a radio signal from the remote control. The Odyssey has multiple interior temperature sensors for the automatic climate control system. Does the Odyssey&rsquo;s always-on computer have enough logic to say</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    IF child crying in interior 
       AND car is parked and off 
       AND interior temperature is above 100 degrees
    THEN
       roll windows down
       send text message to owners
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>? No. In fact, the Odyssey&rsquo;s computer will happily sit there, with all of its sensors telling it &ldquo;a child is being roasted to death&rdquo;, and do nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe someday our cars will be as smart as our phones. Anyone else
have advice on a great minivan?</p>

          <p>I enjoyed
<a href="http://twitter.com/FutureDocs/status/38428516961751040">@FutureDocs</a>'
<a href="http://futuredocsblog.com/2010/10/20/preparing-for-attending-rounds-some-things-don%E2%80%99t-change/">guide to medical student oral presentations</a>,
so I thought I&rsquo;d share the cheat sheet that I give to the medical
students and PA students when I start each teaching block. As she
mentioned, presentations always have to be tailored to the listener,
and each attending is different, so you&rsquo;ll see minor differences in
what I recommend.</p>
<p>To me, the most important aspects are organization and preparation. I
don&rsquo;t like to have the sense that the student is &ldquo;winging it&rdquo;. Prepare
for each presentation like you are preparing to give a talk to a
roomful of people. For me, that meant practicing the presentation at
home and with the residents before I presented to an attending.</p>
<p>I also give each student a printed copy of the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/medclerk/drupal/pages/Oral-Presentation-Guidelines">guidelines posted at the University of Washington&rsquo;s medical education site</a>. It
goes into more detail about all of these issues. My favorite portion
is the graph that they present, which I&rsquo;ll reproduce here:</p>
<p><img src="/images/uwash-med-student-presentation.png" alt="Listener Attention" title="Skip
the Boring Stuff"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1XjKZsHu_Q54rL9EwtPtS9via-hEs67H2fRDEs8eHAZc">printable copy of my cheat sheet</a>.</p>
<h3 id="initial-presentation">Initial Presentation:</h3>
<p><strong>CC/ID</strong></p>
<p>Be Brief. Gets the listener primed for what type of case is going to be presented.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a 33 year old male with a history of asthma who presents with a chief complaint of dyspnea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HPI</strong></p>
<p>This is the meat of the presentation. Pretend that you&rsquo;re telling the
patient&rsquo;s story to a friend. How much information would they need to
really understand what the patient is going through? Think about it
from the patient&rsquo;s perspective. What was the tipping point that made
them seek medical attention? What have they tried to make things
better? Stay consistent in your timeline. I like to start at the last
point that the patient was completely well. In patients with chronic
illness, that is hard, so you may have to start at the last time that
they were &ldquo;relatively&rdquo; well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was completely well (or &ldquo;in his usual state of health&rdquo; for chronically ill patients) until 5 days ago, when he noticed feeling short of breath after walking 300 feet to his mailbox. Over the course of the next 5 days, his dyspnea worsened to the point that he was short of breath at rest. He tried taking his albuterol inhaler, but felt no relief. Etc…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s also useful to split the HPI into 2 distinct sections. The first
part is the patient&rsquo;s story, as described above. In the second part,
you take that story and decide what a reasonable differential
diagnosis list would be after listening to the first part. Then
provide the listener with appropriate ROS and PMH items to help them
rule those other diagnoses out.</p>
<p><strong>PMH</strong></p>
<p>You may have mentioned a few of these in the CC, but repeat them
here. For most conditions, just list the diagnosis, but if it has
particular pertinence to the HPI, then provide more detail. Also, try
to give some indication of the severity of the condition for certain
conditions: CHF (EF), DM (A1C), COPD (FEV1).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Past medical history includes Asthma. He has been hospitalized twice in the past year, and required mechanical ventilation in April. He also has hypertension and allergic rhinitis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Meds</strong></p>
<p>List meds like a robot :-) Include doses if they are important. You&rsquo;ll
learn the importance of doses with experience. In general, if the med
is related to the HPI, I want to know the dose. You can&rsquo;t go wrong by
just giving me the dose on each med. Just run through them quickly</p>
<p><strong>FH/SH/ROS</strong></p>
<p>You should obviously have done these portions of the interview, but if
they were important, I would have wanted to hear about it in the
HPI. (Pt lives in a nursing home… Pt smokes… etc.) It&rsquo;s OK to go over
it quickly, but probably better to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FH/SH/ROS is unremarkable aside from what was presented in HPI</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Exam</strong></p>
<p>List the VS: Temp/HR/BP/RR/O2 sat. Then provide an overall impression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, the patient appears tired and seemed to be in mild respiratory distress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pertinent negatives and significant positives only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lung exam was remarkable for diffuse expiratory wheezes with accessory muscle use. Cardiac exam confirmed tachycardia. There was no lower extremity edema and the remainder of the complete physical exam was normal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be completely objective. Avoid downplaying your exam skills. It&rsquo;s OK
to get things wrong – it&rsquo;s often the best way to learn. Avoid patient
interpretations here.</p>
<p><strong>Labs/Xray/EKG/Procedures</strong></p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s all normal, OK to say it&rsquo;s all normal, but if any are
abnormal, I like to hear each value in that group.</p>
<p><strong>ER course</strong></p>
<p>Brief sentence on what happened in the ER before you saw the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment/Plan</strong></p>
<p>Second juicy part of the presentation. Identify each problem and go
one by one. Put the most pressing issue first. If the diagnosis is in
question, give me a differential diagnosis and let me know what we&rsquo;re
doing to rule out items on the differential. If the diagnosis is
relatively certain, present me with various therapeutic options and
the reason why you chose the one you did.</p>
<p>Think about &ldquo;goals of care&rdquo;, if appropriate</p>
<p>Always mention disposition. What are we looking for before the patient
can be discharged? In some cases, this will be nebulous, but at least
mention it. &ldquo;Disposition is unclear at this point because of X&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Overnight course</strong></p>
<p>What happened after you put your plan in place? Brief status report on
how patient is doing today.</p>
<h3 id="subsequent-day-presentations">Subsequent Day Presentations:</h3>
<p><strong>1 line about patient</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms Jones is our 87 year old woman here with an aspiration pneumonia</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Overnight course</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since yesterday&rsquo;s rounds, she has had a speech evaluation and they recommended a video swallow study. She had one temperature spike to 38.5 degrees and blood cultures were drawn. She appears to more comfortable this morning, though she is still confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Exam</strong>: Vitals, superquick exam describing pertinents only</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong>: Any new labs that came back since we met for rounds yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for today</strong>: Go by problem again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Problem 1: aspiration pneumonia, she&rsquo;s on D3 of Zosyn and we will continue to followup cultures. Overall she seems improved, but we&rsquo;ll have to continue to monitor her mental status and oxygenation for further improvement. Problem 2: Altered mental status: This is almost certainly due to her pneumonia, but if it does not improve by tomorrow, we may consider other etiologies. At that point, repeat labs, EKG, and head CT may be indicated.  &hellip; Problem 53: Disposition &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be prepared to answer questions if you have been appropiately brief!</p>

    <a href="https://vkurup.github.io/blog/2011/02/16/aspirin-for-everyone/">Aspirin for everyone</a>
  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Aspirin is one of those wonder drugs - simple, cheap and effective
versus so many deadly diseases. We know that aspirin prevents heart
attacks and strokes, especially if you&rsquo;ve had one before. There is
also some data that it prevents colon cancers, but it was thought that
this effect was only seen when using high doses of aspirin. The
downside of aspirin is that it increases your risk of bleeding,
especially gastrointestinal bleeding (usually from stomach
ulcers). Using <em>high</em> doses of aspirin tends to increase the bleeding
risk so much that it offsets any benefits.</p>
<p>When someone has had a stroke or heart attack, using aspirin is a
no-brainer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease#Secondary_prevention">secondary prevention</a>). The
question is when to start aspirin in patients who have never had a bad
event (<a href="http://www.enotes.com/public-health-encyclopedia/primary-prevention">primary prevention</a>). We
used to be much more liberal about recommending aspirin for primary
prevention, but there haven&rsquo;t been many studies which have supported
the practice. The current guidelines state to consider starting
aspirin for primary prevention in men at age 45 and women at age 55,
if their risk of vascular disease outweighs their risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding. That&rsquo;s a wishy-washy way of saying &ldquo;Leave
it up to your gut.&rdquo; (No pun intended)</p>
<p>I decided to write about this because I saw a recent <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144578?dopt=Abstract">study showing decreased deaths from cancer in aspirin users</a>,
even at <strong>low</strong> doses. Overall cancer rates were 20% lower and
gastrointestinal cancer rates were 35% lower than in people who didn&rsquo;t
use aspirin. These data come from 2 meta-analyses of retrospective
studies, which tend to be a relatively weak type of study. Prospective
studies are much better, but these numbers strike me as significant.</p>
<p>Given this new data, I would strongly favor using aspirin in most
people once they hit those age cutoffs (45 &amp; 55), which for me is
pretty soon. Calculate your <a href="http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp">cardiovascular risk</a>. If your risk
is any more than 10% or so, I would recommend taking an aspirin daily,
possibly even if it&rsquo;s lower. The reasons that I would recommend not
taking an aspirin are if you have frequent stomach ulcers, previous
severe bleeding, or if you&rsquo;re taking blood thinners or high doses of
NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen). Here&rsquo;s a nice <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/cvd/aspprovider.htm">fact sheet</a> that summarizes
what I&rsquo;ve just rambled about (Wish I had seen that before I wrote all
this!)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Don&rsquo;t take medical advice from the internet. Show this to
your doctor so they can tell you what a quack I am.</p>

          <p>I take it back. I was upset, OK? Never tweet when you&rsquo;re upset. I&rsquo;m
writing this blog post to make up for it. See, a whole blog post. That
definitely outweighs a tweet, right?</p>
<p>Last week, my 1996 Altima died. The starter seemed to be firing, but the engine never turned over.
We tried jumping it, but that didn&rsquo;t work. I called a tow truck and then tweeted about how upset I
was with the universe.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey universe, I would love to go a full 6 months without a car dying. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/kthxbye?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#kthxbye</a></p>&mdash; Vinod Kurup (@vkurup) <a href="https://twitter.com/vkurup/status/31553126746038272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Snarky, huh? Even stuck the childish #kthxbye in there. Blaming the
universe is kinda like getting upset with God, in a scientist&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>But, it&rsquo;s been a week now, and I&rsquo;ve had time to think about it and I
now realize how lucky I am. Not just in general, because that&rsquo;s
certainly true and something that I remember every time I come home
and see my beautiful wife and kids. But, how lucky I am that my car
died. Let&rsquo;s look at some details. The car was in our neighborhood&rsquo;s
parking lot when it died. I was coming home from work and saw Mala and
the kids playing at the playground, so I pulled into the parking lot
and played with them for a while. When we got in the car to go home,
the car wouldn&rsquo;t start. The car was dead in a parking lot, in a safe
neighborhood, walking distance from our house. Just think of all the
other places that it could&rsquo;ve died. How lucky that it died in that
location, where it was easy for a tow truck to access, where it was
not in the way of traffic, where it was safe, and most importantly,
where it was easy for everyone to get home. The kids enjoyed just
about every moment of the experience (just like Kavi did when our RAV4
died in much more stressful circumstances in NYC last fall).</p>
<p>The tow truck came, did a little testing and then dutifully towed the
car to my mechanic and dropped the key in their dropbox. They found a
distributor filled with oil and some worn out spark plugs. The fixes
weren&rsquo;t cheap, but they weren&rsquo;t too expensive (using rebuilt
parts). I was driving again about 48 hours after the car died and life
is back to normal now. Again, how lucky is that?</p>
<p>I was also thinking about the previous time that the Altima died. I
remember writing this affirmation in my journal, while I was waiting
for the tow truck back in September 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Late entry. This was written on the day that the Nissan&rsquo;s battery
died. Everything will be fine. I will find out later how this will
be a blessing in disguise. This car will give us another 2-3 years
of great service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been 2 and a half years since then and the car has been
steady and reliable throughout that time. How lucky can a guy get?
The Nissan is pushing 140,000 miles and it&rsquo;s not the most convenient
car with the 2 carseats taking up the whole back seat, so I think it&rsquo;s
time for a new car, but how lucky that I have the luxury of taking my
time to find one?</p>
<p>So, Thank you Universe! I look forward to the next lesson that you&rsquo;ve
got in store for me.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I read this book in 2005, but never posted this review. So here it
is&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproduct0671671642ieutf8tagvinodkurupshomeplinkcodeas2camp1789creative390957creativeasin0671671642growing-a-businessa-by-paul-hawken"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Growing a Business<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Paul Hawken</h2>
<p>This is an honest and practical guide to running a business. I don&rsquo;t
remember where I first heard about this book. Maybe <a href="http://pinds.com">Lars</a>?</p>
<p>It was written in 1987. Hawken talks about building a business. It&rsquo;s
often portrayed as a heroic or glamorous endeavor, but really it&rsquo;s
not. It&rsquo;s a lot of hard work, but also a lot of common sense. He spends a
chapter talking about a quality that you need to be successful in your own
business. He calls it Tradeskill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like intuition, for business. He says its something you can&rsquo;t acquire
easily, except perhaps in childhood. People that were drawn into business
activities at a young age have it. Those that weren&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t. And no amount
of book-smarts can make up for the lack of Tradeskill. If you&rsquo;re not
comfortable haggling in a flea market, you should think twice about going
into business. Instead, he recommends dipping your feet in the water,
without starting a business yourself. Take a part time job in a business
that you&rsquo;re interested in and try to take on as many roles as possible in
that business.</p>
<p>Another theme in his book is the wisdom of growing slowly. Having too much
money while starting a business is worse than no having enough. It&rsquo;s
something I read a lot now (Arsdigita, Paul Graham, 37Signals), but it&rsquo;s
interesting to see it written way back when as well.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-learned-from-this-book">Things I learned from this book</h3>
<h2 id="its-probably-not-for-me">It&rsquo;s probably not for me</h2>
<p>Starting your own business is not for everyone. It takes a temperament that
isn&rsquo;t easily learned. I don&rsquo;t think I have Tradeskill. I&rsquo;m not going to let
that stop me from learning about business, but I&rsquo;m going to be a little
more thorough in my planning and preparation if I ever do it.</p>
<h2 id="the-5-15-report-is-a-good-idea">The 5-15 report is a good idea</h2>
<p>He mentions something called a 5-15 report. it&rsquo;s a report that every
employee in a company should have to write <strong>every</strong> week. It should take
less than 15 minutes to write and less than 5 minutes to read. Part I is a
progress report for the week, Part II is a report on the morale of the
department and Part III is one idea to make the company better. I like the
idea of a weekly low-commitment progress report.</p>
<h2 id="overstaffing-is-the-root-of-all-evil">Overstaffing is the root of all evil</h2>
<p>A major problem of big business is over-staffing. Once an employee
learns that their work is redundant, or requires little effort, they
realize their job is expendable and that they must spend all their
time preserving their job - through hijacking credit, office politics,
etc. The basic result is that <strong>people hoard information</strong>. Information
that, if freely disseminated, would allow the company to function
better. If I have useful information that other employees don&rsquo;t have,
then I am valuable. Understaffed companies (start-ups) work in the
opposite way. I have enough work as it is, so I&rsquo;m happy to share
information with you, because perhaps it will allow you to help me out
with my workload. The company becomes more efficient. I see this
effect of over-staffing where I work (although I didn&rsquo;t recognize it
as such until reading this book)</p>
<h3 id="random-quotes--concepts-from-the-book">random quotes / concepts from the book</h3>
<p>Flat management/employee structures are good. Trust the people you work with and
give them wide latitude.</p>
<p>Problems are opportunities - dive into them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good business has interesting problems. A bad business has boring ones.&rdquo; (p. 39)</p>
<p>Have a partner. You shouldn&rsquo;t ever think of going it alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being in business is not about making money. It is a way to become who you are.&rdquo; (p. 19)</p>

          <p>I had my first full phone conversation with Kavi today. I was about to
leave work, so I called home to let Mala know that I was on my way
home. (For the second time&hellip; I got called back to help in the ER on
my first attempt, but that&rsquo;s another story). When the phone rang, Kavi
picked up the phone. &ldquo;Hi Daddy, when are you coming home?&rdquo; I told him
that I was leaving now and that I&rsquo;d be home in half an hour. &ldquo;OK
Daddy. Bye!&rdquo; <em>Click</em></p>
<p>Hopefully, he gave the message to Mala :-)</p>

          <p>If you get this error message:</p>
<pre><code>Can't exec &quot;autopoint&quot;: No such file or directory at /usr/share/autoconf/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you need to install autopoint:</p>
<pre><code>sudo aptitude install autopoint
</code></pre>
<p>I ran into this while building
<a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger">ledger</a> today and had never
needed to do that before. The error that <code>acprep</code> provides is even
more cryptic:</p>
<pre><code>Automatically preparing build ... Warning: autoreconf failed
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I ran <code>autogen.sh</code> and the autpoint error showed up.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Another piece of advice that I&rsquo;ve heard over and over again is to make
things easier. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/09/how-to-be-dispensable-and-why-you-should-document-and-automate-yourself-out-of-a-job/">Automate!</a>
In that vein, I learned a little elisp in order to make it easier to
create a new blog post. I create my posts in emacs, but I often cut
and paste the YAML header from a previous post, which is tedious and
time-consuming. Here is my new posting function:</p>
<pre><code>(defun vk-blogpost (title)
  &quot;Create a new blog post.&quot;
  (interactive &quot;sPost Title: &quot;)
  (let ((slug (replace-regexp-in-string &quot; &quot; &quot;-&quot; (downcase title))))
    (find-file (concat &quot;~/web/kurup.org/_posts/&quot;
                       (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)
                       &quot;-&quot; slug &quot;.markdown&quot;))
    (insert &quot;---\n&quot;)
    (insert &quot;date: &quot; (format-time-string &quot;%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S&quot;) &quot;\n&quot;)
    (insert &quot;layout: post\n&quot;)
    (insert &quot;title: &quot; title &quot;\n&quot;)
    (insert &quot;categories: \n&quot;)
    (insert &quot;---\n\n&quot;)))
</code></pre>
<p>After asking me for a title, it creates a new file and massages the
title to create a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(web_publishing)">slug</a>. It
automatically enters the date of the post, both in the filename and
in the YAML header. This took me about an hour to write, mostly in
googling elisp commands. Hopefully, it will save time in the long run,
but even if it doesn&rsquo;t, it was fun to write :-)</p>
<p>Any feedback on my primitive elisp would be appreciated!</p>
