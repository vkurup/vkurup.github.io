<p>I can barely believe it myself, but I ran 20 miles this morning in Central Park. The <a href="http://www.nyrrc.org/race/2003/r0906x00.htm">New York Road Runners Club organized a long run</a> for people training for fall marathons. The longest I had run before was about 17 miles for my Chicago Marathon training, but I remember that &ldquo;run&rdquo; being mostly walking in the second half.</p>
<p>Today went much better. I started with the 10:30 pace group and stayed with them. We ran 4 loops around <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/divisions/training/cpdistances.html">Central Park</a> - the 6 mile loop, the 5 mile upper loop, the 5 mile lower loop and then the 4 mile middle loop. The first 3 loops went smoothly, but I started to die around mile 17 or so. I was able to keep my pace around 10:40 for the last 4 miles, but it seemed much slower. Of course, doing anything more strenuous than thinking is painful right now, but it&rsquo;s a good pain.</p>
<p>The pic to the right is from the Run to Liberty 10K that I ran last week. I ran it as a training run and finished in 1:00:46.</p>

          <p>I got home as it was getting dark, so I ran at the gym, on the
treadmill. I usually hate running indoors, but running on the
treadmill has one huge positive point. You don&rsquo;t have to pay attention
where you&rsquo;re going. I got myself into a groove and before I knew it, I
was done with my 5 miles in about 47 minutes. Much faster than I was
just a few months ago!</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been getting weird emails over the past day or so. The <code>From:</code> address is always different, there is no body text and there is an attachment called <code>your_document.pif</code>. The <code>From:</code> address is sometimes recognizable, but seems to be spoofed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=your_document.pif">Google only gave me 1 document for &ldquo;your_document.pif&rdquo;</a> and that document states that <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/sobig_f.shtml">this is a new virus called W32/Sobig.F-mm</a> (link changed due to 404). Not much info about it yet, but it seems pretty widespread.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Wow, google only had 1 document for the above search when I wrote this a few hours ago and now it has 391! Looks like this virus is just taking off. <a href="http://www.local6.com/news/2420899/detail.html">Fastest. Virus. Ever.</a></p>

<p><b>Sobig.F</b></p>
<p>
According to an article in today's paper (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
8/21/03) This was called the fastest growing virus ever by MessageLabs
Inc. It halted CSX Transportation trains in Washington DC and infected
more than 2000 computers at the University of Wisconsin Madison.  It
infects PC's running Microsoft Windows, and turns PCs into relayers of
spam e-mail clogging computer servers on the internet and crashing
networks.  The subject line could say "Details", Thank You", or
"Wicked screensaver". The virus doesn't appear to be destroying data
or causing other lasting damage to the machines or networks it has
infected.  You just have to face the daunting task of deleting a ton
of virus e-mails.

          <p>The power finally came back on at around 7:20 PM tonight. I was
sitting on my futon trying as hard as I could not to sweat, when I
heard a loud cheer from the courtyard and saw that the lights had gone
on in the apartments outside my window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a weird couple of days. The power went out around 4:15 PM
yesterday while I was looking up some labs in the preceptor&rsquo;s
room. The A/C had been on full-blast, so we all thought that it was
just an overloaded circuit, but soon we got word that nearby buildings
were affected and everyone went smoothly into disaster-mode. Take care
of any urgent patient needs and encourage everyone else to go home. No
staff leaves until we know what&rsquo;s going on. Around 6:30, we got the
word that whoever was within walking distance could go home, provided
that they be back first thing in the morning. I figured 4 miles is
walking-distance, so I left. From the 80&rsquo;s to around 63rd St, 2nd
Avenue was packed with cars trying in vain to get to the Queensboro
bridge. Traffic lights were off, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter since
the cars weren&rsquo;t moving anyway. Civilians were trying to direct
traffic with varying success. The cars obeyed, but pedestrians were on
their own schedule. From the Queensboro down to the 40&rsquo;s, pedestrians
replaced the cars and swarmed over the street.</p>
<p>I got to my neighborhood around 8ish. Most of the local shops were out
of flashlights and running low on water. I swear the people at the
counter were just making up prices as they went along, but no one
really seemed to care. After getting settled at home, I went for a
short walk outside around 10PM. I was shocked at how dark New York was
without any lights. You could clearly see the stars in the sky. It was
dangerous to walk around without a flashlight because there would be
people just sitting on the sidewalk waiting to be tripped over.</p>
<p>But everything is back to normal now and the only casualty is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime">uptime</a></p>
