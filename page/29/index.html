          <p>Not all of OpenACS is Postgres 7.3 compliant yet. OpenACS 5 is compliant and the core packages in OpenACS 4.6 are compliant, but some non-core packages haven&rsquo;t been fixed yet. Noncompliant packages will complain:</p>
<pre><code>[24/Jun/2003:15:21:36][26623.196621][-conn:kurup::4] Error:  Ns_PgExec: result status: 7 message: ERROR:  Function  pa_collection__new(&quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, timestamp with time zone,  &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;) does not exist
Unable to identify a function that satisfies the given argument types
You may need to add explicit typecasts
</code></pre>
<p>It is looking for a function with <code>timestamp with time zone</code> as one of its parameters, but most OpenACS pl/pgsql functions were defined as accepting <code>timestamp</code>. In PG 7.3, <code>timestamp</code> means &lsquo;timestamp <strong>without</strong> timezone&rsquo;. <code>timestamptz</code> means &lsquo;timestamp <strong>with</strong> timezone&rsquo;. So, the quick fix, is to change <code>timestamp</code> to <code>timestamptz</code>.</p>

          <p>psql doesn&rsquo;t deal well with tabs. If you feed it a function that has tabs  in it, and then call that function, you&rsquo;ll often get this:  <code>ERROR:  parser: parse error at or near &quot;for&quot; at character 15</code>.  Thus, if you ever see this in your error log, it&rsquo;s time to <code>M-x untabify</code>.</p>

          <p>I had dinner with a friend of mine whom I hadn&rsquo;t seen in a few
months. Turned out that she had been mugged in the lobby of her
apartment in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen, so she&rsquo;s spent the last few months moving
to a safer neighborhood and dealing with all the pain that goes along
with that. How sobering. Thanks to self-defense classes that she took
in college, she was able to ultimately fight off her attacker by
pushing him away just long enough for her to scream for help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t scream when he&rsquo;s pressed up against you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bastard actually impersonated a police officer in order to get
access to her building. Her one piece of advice for me (or anyone) -
&ldquo;Learn some self defense,&rdquo; and blowing away any myths I might have
believed, &ldquo;Men are targets as often as women because they tend to have
more money on hand.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m slowly in the process of moving my site from PHP/MySQL to OpenACS. Things are broken in the meantime. Specifically, I need to import all my old photos, steal <a href="http://badgertronics.com/blog">MarkD&rsquo;s</a> book module, and implement my family-tree module. If you find something that&rsquo;s broken, feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using an open-source stylesheet from <a href="http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/">The NYPL</a>, but I need to edit it at some point. But for now, at least, it looks better than anything I could drum up by myself.</p>

</header>

        
          <p>My introduction to computers came when I was about 6 or 7 years old - I
can&rsquo;t quite remember exactly when&hellip; Venu Mammen (my uncle) brought home a
terminal from work. It looked like a typewriter, but it had 2
suction-cup-thingys where you could attach a phone headset. (Phone headsets
were pretty much all the same shape back then). Venu Mammen issued some
magical command and then up on the screen came the most amazing
phrase. ADVENTURE v1.0. (Actually, I can&rsquo;t remember for sure if it was a
LED screen or if it was a dot matrix printer output - Do you remember
Manu?.) Anyway, I stayed up late that night (read: 9PM) moving around an
endless maze without really ever getting anywhere. I always sucked at
adventure games&hellip; Despite this failure, I was hooked on computers.</p>







<span class="caption-wrapper right">
  <img class="caption" src="/images/zx80.gif" title="Sinclair ZX-80" alt="Sinclair ZX-80">
  <span class="caption-text">Sinclair ZX-80</span>
</span>

<p>Around 1980, my father brought home a <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/zx80.html">Sinclair ZX-80</a>. This
computer had a whole 1K of RAM, and if you filled up the
RAM - no need to worry. Just hook it up to any handy portable cassette
recorder and you could save all the information you&rsquo;d ever need (well,
about 20K or so). I think my brother wrote a &lsquo;number guessing&rsquo; program&hellip; I
was so impressed.  He saved the program on a cassette tape and I still
remember trying to listen to the tape on the cassette player, half
expecting it to speak, &ldquo;Guess a number from 1 to 100.&rdquo; No luck, though -
programming apparently was a bit more complicated.</p>







<span class="caption-wrapper left">
  <img class="caption" src="/images/iie.gif" title="Apple IIe" alt="Apple IIe">
  <span class="caption-text">Apple IIe</span>
</span>

<p>Some time later, we moved up to the big time (in my estimation). An
<a href="https://apple-history.com/aIIe">Apple IIe</a>
with the Apple III monitor, 1 MHz processor, 64K of RAM (which we later upgraded to 256K!!!!), 2
floppy disk drives and AppleWorks software. This computer served me throughout high school. I began
to dabble with programming in BASIC and assembly. I think that Apple is still sitting in my parents
basement. I&rsquo;ll have to see if I can load up One-on-One again&hellip;</p>
<p>My dad bought a Mac Plus for work when it came out and he let me play on it. I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing. No command line interface. A little arrow that moved in response to my movements on a &ldquo;mouse&rdquo;. Folders that you could move around. I was in heaven! I perused all the manuals that came with it trying to learn as much as I could about this new beast. Around this time, my dad asked me to help him computerize the medical testing that his lab does. I fooled around with HyperCard for about a week and wrote my first Macintosh program.</p>







<span class="caption-wrapper right">
  <img class="caption" src="/images/classicii.gif" title="Mac Classic II" alt="Mac Classic II">
  <span class="caption-text">Mac Classic II</span>
</span>

<p>The first couple years of college, I was computerless. My junior year, I
decided to splurge and I bought a Mac Classic II - 4 MB RAM, 80 MB HD, 16
MHz 68030 processor. That was 1992, back in the beginning days of the
internet. It&rsquo;s pretty surprising, but this was actually marketed as a
business computer. I used that computer faithfully for 5 years. Even after
buying a new computer, I kept my old Classic II cuz I just couldn&rsquo;t bear to
sell it (especially since I&rsquo;d probably only get $20 for it). I finally
donated it to Goodwill in June of 1999.</p>

<p>In February 1997, I decided I needed a new computer. Apple was in the middle of their worst year financially - losing over $1 billion. And unfortunately, their line of computers was a reflection of their financial incompetence. Despite this, I still liked the Mac OS platform, so I investigated the Mac Clones which were much more technically sound. I bought a Power Computing PowerCenter 150 MHz PowerPC 604 with 48 MB RAM, 2 gig HD. So far, this has been an ideal computer and I see it being usable for at least another couple years. (and perhaps even longer, now that I&rsquo;ve installed Linux on it!)</p>

  <span class="caption-text">PowerBook G3 Series</span>

<p>I spent most of 1999 travelling around the country (see my <a href="work.phtml">Work</a> page), so I decided I needed a laptop&hellip;ok, ok&hellip; I <b>wanted</b> a laptop. So, I donated my PowerCenter to my roommate, <a href="imagetable/gerry2.phtml">Gerry</a>, and bought a used PowerBook on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>. It&rsquo;s a Wallstreet 2 - 266 MHz PowerPC  G3, 192 MB, 4 gig HD, and a DVD. I bought this in July 1999 and it was everything I could have imagined. I&rsquo;ve extracted all my CD&rsquo;s into MP3 format and I bought Virtual Game Station, so I could play Playstation games. This computer is now a complete entertainment system - and it only weighs 8 lbs! Now that I have 192 megabytes of RAM, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that our original ZX80 had only 1 kilobyte of RAM! And even my Classic II had a only a 80 megabyte hard drive! That&rsquo;s less than half the amount of <b>RAM</b> I have now&hellip; The way things are going, this computer should last at least a few weeks!</p>

<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s been a while since I updated this page. Around the time I wrote that
last paragraph, I was beginning to get interested in Linux, so I bought
a cheap AMD-K6 processor and put together a little Linux playground. After trying out a few other distros, I finally installed to run
<a href="http://debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> and it&rsquo;s provided me a
wide-open window into the world of <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software</a>
(I&rsquo;m <a href="http://member.fsf.org">associate member</a> #1088). I&rsquo;m not
coming back :-). <a href="http://www.fsf.org/register_form?referrer=1088"><img src="/images/fsf-member.png" alt="[FSF Associate Member]" width="88" height="31" /></a></p>

<p>My Wallstreet finally died in the fall of 2002 and I mercilessly sold it
for the value of its parts. I bought an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMac">eMac</a> because it appealed to my
sense of &ldquo;bang for the buck&rdquo;, but I missed the portability of my
laptop. So, I sold the eMac to Sung&rsquo;s parents and bought the <a
href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/stats/powerbook_g4_1.33_12.html">12-inch Powerbook</a> in the Spring of 2003. I miss the beautiful, expansive screen
of the eMac, but I really love this new toy. The most lovable part of the
Mac is the new operating system, <a href="http://apple.com/macosx">OS X</a>. It combines the stability and geekiness of UNIX with the beauty and
don&rsquo;t-make-me-think usability of the Mac.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to put this pic up for a while. That&rsquo;s me in back,
with my super-cool brother and his even-cooler Harley Davidson
VRod. It was about 40 degrees F and despite sitting in back and
despite having the warm helmet, I was still freezing. I can&rsquo;t imagine
what Manu was feeling. Halfway through the ride, I asked him, but his
face was too frozen to talk. :-)</p>

          <p>My parents and I went to India for 2 weeks. We spent a couple days in
Delhi and then the rest of the time in Kerala. I thoroughly enjoyed
myself and actually found the vacation relaxing. Kerala is more
beautiful than I ever remember (somehow I seem to forget in between
trips). It&rsquo;s lush and green and the food is amazing. I can&rsquo;t wait to
go back. Here are <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5323">some pics</a>. Unfortunately, my
camera battery died while I was in Kottarakara and I was too dense to
bring a 220V converter, so there aren&rsquo;t nearly enough pictures from
Kerala.</p>

    <a href="https://kurup.com/blog/2003/01/07/gerry-and-kim-the-website/">Gerry and Kim - the website</a>
  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I finally finished <a href="http://cherayil.kurup.org">Gerry and Kim&rsquo;s wedding site</a>. The HTTP address is temporary. I had
made a promise to Kim back in September that I would finish it, but
that I needed a deadline. My brain seems to refuse to work without a
deadline. Anyway, she said, &ldquo;end of the year&rdquo; and sure enough, it went
live on 12/31/2002. It&rsquo;s running on <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS 4</a>
(CVS HEAD 12/25/2002), using an Open Source CSS stylesheet from
<a href="http://www.w3.org">http://w3.org</a>. All comments welcome.</p>
<p>Developing this site using a comprehensive framework like OpenACS was
certainly overkill. I started by using
<a href="http://www.phpnuke.org/">PHPNuke</a>,
<a href="http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/">phpwebsite</a> and then
<a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a>. All of them would have
been fine (as would my old favorite, Frontier). The thing is, none of
these worked exactly as I want them out-of-the-box and I&rsquo;d much rather
customize OpenACS for my needs than wade through PHP or
Perl. MovableType was the exception in this group as it worked exactly
as advertised, but it&rsquo;s advertised as weblog software, which is not
what I was building. I also wanted to test out OpenACS 4 since I&rsquo;ve
spent so much of my free time working on it. Like <a href="http://xarg.net/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=19296">Jeff said</a>, you actually
gotta <em>use</em> the software before you figure out where it needs fixin'.</p>
