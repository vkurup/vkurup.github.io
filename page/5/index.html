          <p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s probably too early to worry about this, but I often
wonder about the best way to introduce Kavi and Anika to
computers. &lsquo;Introduce&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t the right word because even Anika has
more experience with computers than I did at that age. So far, though,
computers are something that Daddy and Mommy use to do work, not
things that are for them. We&rsquo;ll show them a Sesame Street video on
YouTube or family pictures on Facebook, but they don&rsquo;t spend any
significant amount of time on it. They&rsquo;re easily entertained without
computers. I know that will change as they get older, but for now at
least, they prefer their toys and their imagination to TV or
computers. Even at their young age, that is rare.</p>
<p>The dilemma is that I <strong>do</strong> want them to learn about technology and learn
how to use it in their lives without being controlled by it. I don&rsquo;t
see anything wrong with exposing them to things like computers, iPads,
YouTube, etc., as long as it is monitored. I just want it to be a
healthy portion of their leisure time, not all of it. So many
children&rsquo;s entertainment options are spoon-fed propaganda. They are
meant to be passively enjoyed, and the child just sits and absorbs
it. The source of the content is often questionable. Advertisers for
big corporations or government trying to get their message to kids
either overtly or subtly.</p>
<p>I like my childhood experience. My first major exposure to computers
was an Apple IIe. There was nothing organized about it. I spent a
large majority of my time playing games, but those were just the
gateway drugs to get me to realize that there was much more power in
those machines. The entire experience was about tinkering. Trying
to figure out how it worked, how to make it work for me, how I could
make it do things. The most exciting days in my childhood were the
days that the inCider magazine arrived with pages of DOS code listings
in the back. Retyping those code listings, making alterations, trying
to figure out how things worked&hellip; that is much more healthy than just
watching a video over and over again. I, of course, was much older
than Kavi is now, so I&rsquo;m not too worried. I just don&rsquo;t want them to
get addicted to a certain concept of what technology is for, before
they have the skills to really take advantage of it.</p>

          <p>Dear patients,</p>

  <span class="caption-text">Why We Get Fat</span>
</span>

I am sorry. I have been giving you bad dietary advice. In medical
school we learned that fat in your diet causes fat to accumulate in
your arteries, causing heart attacks and strokes, so I told you to eat
a low fat diet. Of course, looking back, we had no evidence to support
that conclusion, but it just seemed rather obvious. Obvious ideas are
often the most dangerous ideas of all. When you see a study that
<strong>might</strong> confirm your obvious idea, you give it extra weight. When
you see a study that <strong>might</strong> refute your obvious idea, you find
problems with the study. When the idea is less certain, then you tend
to give the empirical evidence more weight. This is what we&rsquo;ve done
with the hypothesis that dietary fat causes heart disease.</p>
<p>I just finished Gary Taubes&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307272702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vinodkurupshomep&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0307272702">Why We Get Fat</a>. It&rsquo;s
not a perfect book, but I do recommend it. He dispels myths about why
obesity occurs, explains what really causes it, and discusses why our
current medical and public health approaches to obesity are hurting
rather than helping. He starts out by dispelling the myth that obesity
is caused by an imbalance of &ldquo;Calories In&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Calories Out&rdquo;, and
more specifically, that obesity can be fixed by reversing that
imbalance. This is something I certainly believed. I&rsquo;ve always told
patients to eat less and exercise more. <a href="/blog/2006/10/23/health-at-every-size/">It doesn&rsquo;t work.</a> Instead of calorie
imbalance causing obesity, he states that obesity (and growth in
general) <strong>causes</strong> a calorie imbalance. The increased amount of fat
cells require more energy for sustenance, and therefore our bodies
find a way to increase the amount of calories that we take in,
compared to what we expend. So, while it is true that taking in more
calories than you expend causes your weight to go up, it is not true
that you have much control over your calorie intake or
expenditure. That&rsquo;s determined by hormones. This is the part that is
counter-intuitive. It would seem that I could control the amount of
calories that I eat or that I spend. You might have some control over
what foods you put in your mouth, buy you have no control over how the
calories are extracted or absorbed. You also have no control over the
lower level hormonal signals that make you hungry. Those signals have
evolved over millions of years to be very powerful because in
prehistoric periods, if they didn&rsquo;t work, you died. It&rsquo;s hard to
overcome that kind of evolutionary power with &ldquo;willpower&rdquo;. Even if you
are successful in decreasing the calories that you eat, your body will
naturally decrease the calories that you burn. The variables are
dependent on each other.</p>
<h2 id="the-villain-is-carbs">The villain is carbs</h2>
<p>This leads to the next question: Why do we get obese? If it&rsquo;s not a
simple matter of eating more calories than we expend, then why do we
get fat? The culprit is insulin. Insulin causes the cells of our body
to deposit fat. Insulin, in turn, is released whenever there is
glucose in our system, which is preferentially caused by carbohydrate
intake. Taubes goes into great detail about
the workings of the endocrine system, explaining why insulin is such a
powerful factor in causing fat deposition. It also explains the
phenomenon of why people who have plenty of fat still get so
ravenously hungry. Insulin prevents fat from being turned into energy
so muscle cells have to use carbohydrates, a much smaller pool of
energy. Once it runs out, intense hunger sets in and the eating cycle
starts again. Reading these chapters took me back to my med school
physiology courses. I learned all of this in med school, but we were
never taught to connect these well accepted facts with the things that
we were being taught in our dietary lectures.</p>
<p>Eliminating carbs from our diet without restricting any other nutrient
will stop the fat deposition process, which in turn will decrease our
calorie requirements, which will cause us to lose weight. There is
quite a bit of genetic variation from person to person, so some
individuals will be able to tolerate more carbs than others, and not
everyone will be completely lean even without any carbs.</p>
<p>He spends a lot of time going over the history of dietary research
dating back centuries. The danger of carbs was well understood and
accepted in all scientific and nonscientific circles until the last 50
years or so, when there was a change that attributed obesity to
behavioral weakness. This was started by the acceptance of the calorie
imbalance hypothesis. Once people accepted the thinking that taking in
more calories than you expend causes obesity, it was a short step to
blaming obesity on the individual for not controlling their diet or
exercising more. The focus of scientific research was taken off of fat
deposition and on to behavioral changes.</p>
<p>I had been coming around to this conclusion slowly over the past few
years (and am embarrassed that it has taken me this long). I remember
reading about the Atkins Diet about 10 years ago and thinking how
reckless Dr. Atkins was being by suggesting something which was so
obviously wrong. My thinking started to change a few years back when I
saw Mala struggle to lose weight despite strictly following an 800
calorie diet. I didn&rsquo;t think that kind of calorie restriction was
possible, but I watched with my own eyes as she did it and still
barely saw results. That opened my eyes, and over the past few years,
I&rsquo;ve seen more and more results with low carb diets. Results which
include weight loss, better cholesterol profiles, and overall better
health. Interestingly, the diet recommendations that are provided in
the book are from <a href="http://www.dukehealth.org/physicians/eric_c_westman">Eric Westman, MD</a>, a UW trained
physician who works just down the street from me.</p>
<p>Mala and I have been trying to get healthier over the past 8
months. My brother started a Biggest Loser competition amongst a bunch
of us, and Mala won the first season. We&rsquo;ve been exercising with more
regularity and eating better. Together, we&rsquo;ve lost over 80 lbs. To
complicate the points that I&rsquo;ve been making in this post, we have
<strong>NOT</strong> been following a strict low carb diet, and we <strong>have</strong> been
counting calories. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m certain we&rsquo;re eating less
carbs than we did before. But Mala&rsquo;s focus has been on making
delicious (gourmet!) fresh food using &ldquo;real food&rdquo; ingredients. She&rsquo;s
tried to cut processed food completely out of our diet. I think that
makes a huge difference. We&rsquo;re not meant to eat chemicals and we have
no idea what these chemicals are doing to us. Optimizing food for
specific criteria, whether that&rsquo;s low-fat, low-carb, or whatever, is
bound to have unintended consequences. In that vein, I agree with
Michael Pollan&rsquo;s recommendation to &ldquo;Eat Real Food&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At some point, I&rsquo;d like to review all the science behind the
conclusions in Taubes&rsquo; book, just so I can have a better understanding
for myself. I recommend that anyone treating patients (nurses,
doctors, nutritionists, trainers) or anyone trying to get healthier
read this book.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I love running. Wait, that&rsquo;s a lie. I love running after I&rsquo;ve finished
my run. I also love it during those periods where I get my runner&rsquo;s
high, usually around the 30 minute mark, but often it happens multiple
times after that point. I <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> love running when I&rsquo;m
contemplating going for a run. There are rare occasions where I&rsquo;m just
itching to go for a run, but usually I&rsquo;m only able start a run by
forcibly suppressing the compelling rationalizations that my brain
develops. My brain is really good at finding reasons not to run. One
trick that seems to work is to tell my brain that I have the right to
turn around when I get to the mailbox at the end of the driveway. Of
course, once I&rsquo;ve done the mechanics of getting my shoes and starting,
I never turn around. My brain is so gullible.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t love my run during the first 10 to 15 minutes. Those are
always a struggle. Always. Stretching beforehand makes it less of a
struggle, but I hate stretching, so I rarely do that. I have a few
techniques to get myself through the beginnings of my runs.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Count</strong>: Just count from 1 to 100. Once you get to a hundred, start
over. This one works the best. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s first!</li>
<li><strong>Mantra</strong>: Repeat a mantra to yourself. My favorites are: <em>Keep
covering ground</em> (inspired by my favorite running book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0915297019/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vinodkurupshomep&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0915297019">Once a Runner</a>) and <em>Just keep swimming</em>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Hkn-LSh7es" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: Start thinking about what I&rsquo;m going to eat after the
run. OK, this rarely helps, but I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</li>
<li><strong>Slow</strong>: If I&rsquo;m really feeling sluggish, then I force myself to slow
down. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, <a href="/blog/2009/09/22/running-slow/">running slow</a> is probably the most important
running technique I have. It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive, but it always
work. Running slower than I think I should always makes the run go
faster than I thought it would.</li>
<li><strong>Shorten</strong>: Shorten your stride. I aim to get 3 strides per
second, which seems really quick to me. In order to do that I shorten
my stride. I think most runners would benefit from a shorter
stride. It automatically improves your form.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, all of these are tricks to get your mind to focus on
something else besides the pain of the run. One thing that also helps
is to listen to music or podcasts. It works by the same principle of
getting your mind off the pain, but I found that my best runs were
always the ones where I left the iPod at home. It certainly makes the
beginning of the run harder, but it frees my brain up to really listen
to my body. I would otherwise find myself adjusting my pace to the
beat of the music, rather than to the pace that my body naturally
wanted to go. I also tend to have my deepest thoughts (don&rsquo;t laugh!)
when I&rsquo;m running and having music pumped in would drown those out. I
consider it my meditation practice, since I suck at real
meditation. Finally, it&rsquo;s a safety issue. When running in the woods,
you never know what kind of creature will attack:</p>

<p>Take my advice for what it&rsquo;s worth&hellip; running advice from a part-time
runner who is slower than molasses. I&rsquo;d love to hear any other running
tricks you have!</p>

          <p>Ever since my Dad brought home an Apple IIe back in 1980, I&rsquo;ve been a
huge Apple fan. The design of my website back in the mid 90&rsquo;s was a
ripoff of the Mac OS 9 System menu. (I found a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011110214204/http://kurup.com/index.phtml">later version on the Wayback Machine</a>. I
had swapped out the Apple icon for the icon of the startup I was
working with at the time.) I loved OS X for a while, especially on my
12&rdquo; Aluminum powerbook. But over time, I got more and more frustrated
by it. I wanted to be able to configure more. When the hard drive on
that Powerbook died, I decided to move to all linux.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">trying to visualize life without a mac</p>&mdash; Vinod Kurup (@vkurup) <a href="https://twitter.com/vkurup/status/1207289044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2009</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I am happy and productive, but I am occasionally jealous of Mac OS X. I set
up a Mac Airbook for my mother-in-law a few months ago and &hellip; can I
just drool for a minute about that computer? But, I was able to set it
up, wipe up my drool, and then return to my Ubuntu machines without
too many pangs of jealousy. For the stuff that I do, Linux works
perfectly.</p>
<p>The one pain point that I&rsquo;ve been having over the past few years is
video editing. I take a lot of movies of the kids and I like to do
some very simple editing of them before uploading them to
youtube. This was super easy in
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> back in 2007. I haven&rsquo;t
found a similar experience on Linux. It&rsquo;s reassured me a little to
hear that iMovie has gotten weaker and weaker over the years, so I
didn&rsquo;t feel any need to go back to Mac for this one function.</p>
<p>I had been using <a href="http://www.kinodv.org/">Kino</a>, but the developer
stopped working on it and it had some minor bugs. It doesn&rsquo;t play well
with PulseAudio, the overarching audio system in linux. So I had to
start it with the command <code>padsp kino</code> which allows kino to bypass
PulseAudio. That then makes all other sound on the computer stop until
I quit Kino. And with every OS update, there would be minor changes
that would require me to fiddle with the audio settings
again. Finally, I didn&rsquo;t really understand the Export settings, so my
videos were never as optimized as they could be. There were tabs for
DVD and MPEG output, but there was also one for Other and there were
MPEG options in there too. I was thoroughly confused and was hoping
for something to come along that would be better. Mark Pilgrim
mentioned OpenShot once and I looked at it back then, but I couldn&rsquo;t
figure it out. I tried valiantly for a day and then returned to
hacking on Kino.</p>
<p>Fast forward about a year and after a little more frustration with how
my videos looked on youtube, I gave
<a href="http://www.openshotvideo.com/">OpenShot</a> another try. Version 1.2 is
packaged in Ubuntu 10.10, but 1.3 offered some other nice features,
like exporting directly to Youtube, so I downloaded the
<a href="http://www.openshot.org/ppa/">PPA</a> and installed 1.3.</p>

<p>What a breath of fresh air! It was so easy to import clips. It was so
easy to place clips on the timeline. It was easy to splice and add
transitions. It was easy to add titles. Most importantly it was easy
to export to HD video format so now the videos look better on Youtube.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use Linux for its video editing capabilities. I use it because
I believe in the idea of free software and because for my purposes,
emacs and a web browser are all that I really need. But I am
pleasantly surprised when I see something like OpenShot evolve and
improve to the point that it solves my problem exactly. I will be
donating some dollars over there.</p>

    <a href="https://vkurup.github.io/blog/2011/08/09/running-as-a-metaphor-for-life/">Running as a metaphor for life</a>
  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I was thinking the other day, on a run, of course, about the many ways
that running is a metaphor for life. I&rsquo;ve <a href="/blog/2003/10/28/the-wall-is-not-a-myth/">discussed some of this before with my cousins Dilu and Harish</a> before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; two roads diverged in a wood, and I &ndash;<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While trail running, I have come to the realization that you never
have to worry about the fork in the road, nor the decision associated
with it. During my first trail run in the forest near our home, I was
amazed by the number of single track trailheads that I saw. I didn&rsquo;t
take any of them that first day, content to just take the wide dirt
path along the creek. After a few runs though, I started to take some
of the single track trails and found myself amongst even more
beautiful nature. I found more forks in the trails and I agonized a
bit about taking the right one, mainly so I wouldn&rsquo;t get lost. Now
that I&rsquo;ve run in the woods dozens of times, I don&rsquo;t worry about the
fork in the road. I know that I can take one fork today and the other
fork tomorrow.</p>
<p>Life is like that too. Every decision point seems so important. Making
the wrong decision seems like it will doom me forever. But, I&rsquo;ve found
so far that there are very few decisions that are not
reversible. Certainly some are, but even the important ones like
career and family don&rsquo;t have to be set in stone. I wish I had come to
this realization earlier. Every decision seems so final at the time
that I&rsquo;m making it, but when you look back it seems obvious that there
are plenty of options available, no matter which path you chose. Even
knowing that bias, it&rsquo;s hard to remember that when a new decision has
to be made.</p>
<p>Some of the single track trails have pathmarkers to help keep you on
the right trail. They are little numbered plastic circles nailed to a
tree. They are few and far between. Occasionally, you&rsquo;ll come to a
fork in the trail and there won&rsquo;t be an obvious pathmarker around, so
you have to make a decision. That can be somewhat stressful, so you
keep your eyes peeled for pathmarkers as you&rsquo;re running to see if you
made the right decision. At some point, you&rsquo;ve gone so far without
seeing a marker that you&rsquo;re almost certain that you&rsquo;ve gone the wrong
way. Either you keep the faith and keep going, or you turn around and
try the other fork. There is no right answer.</p>
<p>Life is sometimes like that. We have signposts and decision trees that
are easy to follow in many cases. But inevitably, there will be a
point where we have to make a decision without all of the evidence or
without all of the data or without a clear idea of where we&rsquo;re
going. Not until you take that leap of faith will you get the signal
that you&rsquo;ve made the right decision. And sometimes that signal won&rsquo;t
come for a long time. I&rsquo;m not sure what the point of this is, but it
seemed very profound at the time while I was running in the woods,
about to give up, thinking that I had gone down the wrong path, when I
suddenly saw the elusive pathmarker that confirmed that I was not
lost. Trail running is like that&hellip; everything is not set in stone and
predefined. You have to develop your faith and intuition, and if that
fails, accept that maybe you&rsquo;ll do better next time.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Ever since I was a boy, I have been singing a song called &lsquo;Daivame
Kaithozham&rsquo;, which is pronounced &lsquo;Dave-O-May Kie-Tho-Ram&rsquo;. My parents
taught it to me when I was about 5 years old, so I learned it by
learning the syllables in the song. I know bits and pieces of
Malayalam, but not enough to know what the words of the song
mean. Whenever I&rsquo;m feeling stressed, I sing it under my breath and it
makes me feel better. Kavi wasn&rsquo;t the best sleeper as a baby, so we
spent a lot of time singing him back to sleep. Daivame Kaithozham was
one of my standbys and he has heard it literally thousands of
times. Even now, I sing it to him and Anika almost daily, though he
has requested that I cut it down to weekly. (He likes Laurie Berkner&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Moon, moon, moon&rdquo; better. Oh well.) Both Anika and Kavi have heard it
enough that they can mimic me singing it, though they don&rsquo;t know the
words&hellip;  mostly just the rhythm. But, it&rsquo;s the cutest thing in the
world to see Anika pick up her doll, put it on the floor and start
singing &ldquo;Daivame&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, I finally (after 30 something years) asked my parents what the
song means, so here is the translation. I&rsquo;m not the most religious
person in the world, but if you replace God with whatever supernatural
force you believe in, I think it&rsquo;s a nice simple prayer.</p>

          <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I keep reading books about entrepreneurship. I like
the idea of building a business, having passion for something, and
most importantly, living life on your own terms. I just <a href="/blog/2010/11/07/growing-a-business">don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m cut out for it</a>. But see if
that will stop me from devouring <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://mixergy.com">startup podcasts</a> and books like <a href="http://sivers.org">Derek Sivers&rsquo;</a> <a href="http://t.co/rdADtHa">Anything You Want</a>.</p>
<p>Derek was a musician who started selling his own CDs online in the
days before Paypal. He agreed to help a friend by selling his friend&rsquo;s
CDs as well, and eventually CD Baby was born. He built it into a
successful business and sold it for $22 million. This book is a set of
stories of how that happened. An <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/57644/Anything-You-Want-21-Inspiring-Ideas-From-Derek-Sivers.aspx">excellent bullet point summary</a>
of the book is available. This short book was filled with interesting
advice and stories, but here&rsquo;s my main takeaways.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-helping-people">Focus on helping people</h3>
<p>It would seem like the way to build a successful business would be to
focus on things like profits, or markets, or costs, but Derek says to
ignore all that and focus on helping people. He started by helping out
a fellow musician, and he made sure that every decision he made was in
the name of helping independent musicians. If big labels asked to be
added to CD Baby, he said no. If people recommended placing ads on his
site, he said no. If a business offered some kind of big money
partnership which required him to change the way he ran his business,
he said no. Find someone you can help and provide enough value to that
person to make them happy to pay you for the help and you will have a
successful business.</p>
<h3 id="make-something-perfect-not-big">Make something perfect, not big</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I thought that by taking an unrealistically utopian approach, I could keep the business from growing too much. Instead of trying to make it big, I was going to make it small. It was the opposite of ambition, so I had to think in a way that was the opposite of ambitious.</p>
<p>The key point is that I wasn&rsquo;t trying to make a big business. I was just daydreaming about how one little thing would look in a perfect world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Derek actively tried to keep his business from growing. At some point,
he was making enough money that he felt the growth of the business
would only create more headaches for him. Instead of trying to get
more business, he would try to make his current business
perfect. Focus on ways to make the business run the way you want the
world to work. Build your utopia. If you are always focused on growing
the business, you eventually have to make compromises between what
your current customers want and what &ldquo;potential&rdquo; customers want. But,
if your current customers are the ones who you&rsquo;re passionate about
serving, then making their experience even better will paradoxically
bring growth, while also making your life as a business owner more
fulfilling.</p>
<h3 id="this-book-is-not-about-business">This book is not about business</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know in advance, to make sure you&rsquo;re staying focused on what&rsquo;s honestly important to you, instead of doing what others think you should.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a book about life. Focus on helping people and good things
will happen to you. Figure out what makes you tick, what makes you
happy, and what drains you. Adjust your life to give you more time to
do what makes you happy and stop doing the things that drain
you. Derek&rsquo;s rule about this is &ldquo;HELL, YEAH!&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. If someone
offers you an opportunity and you don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;HELL, YEAH!&quot;, then say
&ldquo;no&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t go halfway. Do things that you love. (His actual rule is a
little more &lsquo;explicit&rsquo;, as he describes in this
<a href="http://mixergy.com/derek-sivers-blog-interview/">podcast</a>)</p>
<h3 id="a-few-other-quotes-that-i-loved">A few other quotes that I loved</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h5 id="getting-things-done-isnt-the-only-goal">Getting things done isn&rsquo;t the only goal</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>[Other people] assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way. But that&rsquo;s forgetting about the joy of learning and doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="know-thyself">Know thyself</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Just pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you. Pay close attention to when you&rsquo;re being the real you and when you&rsquo;re trying to impress the invisible jury.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="unexpected-twist">Unexpected twist</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>So I considered firing everyone and hiring a whole new crew. &hellip; I never saw or spoke to my employees again. Never saw the office again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t expecting to read that. Thought that he would find a way to
patch things up, but stuff like this happens in the real world.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-do-customer-service">How to do customer service</h3>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t from the book, but was in a <a href="http://mixergy.com/derek-sivers-blog-interview/">great Mixergy interview</a> that I
heard after finishing the book. He describes his customer service
philosophy as the <strong>Mick Jagger philosophy</strong>. Pretend that every customer
service request you get is from Mick Jagger. (Assuming your company is
in the music business). If someone emails you a request about how they
can&rsquo;t access a PDF file on your site, that might seem like an annoying
complaint. But if you pretend that it&rsquo;s coming from Mick Jagger, you&rsquo;d
respond &ldquo;Wow, thanks for emailing me. Here, let me just get that PDF
for you and attach it to this email. Again, please let me know if
there&rsquo;s anything else I can do for you!&rdquo; And if that is heartfelt,
customers will love you.</p>
<h3 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h3>
<p>I enjoyed this book. It&rsquo;s a quick read, it&rsquo;s cheap (I read the Kindle
version on my Android tablet for $7.99) and it&rsquo;s inspirational. I
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->recommend it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I just can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been almost 10 years since I
left Boston. Mala had a meeting there and we love to take advantage of
our employers&rsquo; generosity <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I TrippedIt <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> back to Boston for
some nostalgia with 2 kids in tow (Ages 4 and 2). Buildings and
restaurants have come and gone <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, but it seems like so little has
changed in 10+ years. I forgot how &ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo; the city was. The trip
was a few weeks ago, so it&rsquo;s not fresh in my mind anymore, but I
remember thinking that vividly while I was there. You get the sense
that everyone has their shields up (or their guns drawn, to mix
metaphors) for whatever reason. None of the experiences were horrible,
but it was little things&hellip; Bathrooms are &ldquo;broken&rdquo; in every fast food
restaurant. Restaurants have arcane rules: &ldquo;No, we only do takeout
after 3PM&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cash Only - there&rsquo;s an ATM over there&rdquo;. Customer
service people must be groomed to be rude. We&rsquo;re members of the
(AWESOME!)  <a href="http://www.ncmls.org/">Durham Museum of Life and Science</a>
which gives us free entry to science museums around the country, so we
walked up to the Members desk at Boston&rsquo;s version (Museum of Science)
and promptly got lectured about how we weren&rsquo;t really members and next
time we should go in the Nonmembers line. (Um, we&rsquo;re visiting from
North Carolina&hellip; there&rsquo;s probably not going to be a next time anytime
soon). I actually turned around and looked at all of the people behind
me and apologized for our rudeness. Wait! There was no one else
waiting! Just makes you feel small, which burns me up, because I know
that was her objective. I know none of that seems all that bad, but
that general attitude seemed prevalent and brought back memories of
Boston that I had repressed. We all had a great time in Boston, but I
am so glad that I&rsquo;m living in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Wow, that little interlude took me from excited to depressed in no
time flat. Enough of that. Let&rsquo;s talk about the fun stuff we did. We
always research on the web to get a sense of things Kavi and Anika
might like. I had trouble finding good first-person stories about
<strong>Boston trips with little kids</strong>, so here&rsquo;s mine, in case someone has 2
kids exactly like ours. If this is useful, or if you have stuff to
add, please leave a comment or point to your blog.</p>
<h3 id="things-the-kids-loved">Things the kids loved:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Being in Boston: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in BOSTON!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Walking the streets and seeing all kinds of vehicles: Taxis, buses,
trolleys, Ducks, police cars, and most excitingly, Minivans!.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/exhibits/mapparium">Mapparium</a> at Mary Baker Eddy Library:
Kavi talked about this a lot for the rest of the trip, but at the
time didn&rsquo;t seem all that impressed by it. He was intrigued by the
fact that I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to take pictures inside it. He also liked
the Hall of Ideas and the computerized art programs upstairs.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bostoncentral.com/activities/parks/p2055.php">Boston Common Carousel</a>:
It&rsquo;s a carousel. Of course they loved it!
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://www.swanboats.com/">Swan boats</a>:
Definitely a must-do. It&rsquo;s short and sweet.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://www.schon.com/public/ducklings-boston.php">Ducklings in the Garden</a>:
Dressed in Bruins outfits while we were there. Those poor ducks were
constantly surrounded by little ones.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Boston Commons and Garden:
There&rsquo;s plenty of stuff for the kids to see and do here, but they&rsquo;re not so big that you&rsquo;ll get lost (think Central Park).
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://gocitykids.parentsconnect.com/attraction/boston-common-playground-boston-common-boston-ma-02111-us">Boston Commons Playground</a>:
Every parent on a trip knows that step one is finding all the local
playgrounds. This is a nice one and was close to the hotel. That
meets all the necessary requirements. By the way, while putting this
post together, I found this nice listing of <a href="http://gocitykids.parentsconnect.com/sub-category/boston-ma-usa/places-to-go/outdoors/playgrounds">playgrounds in Boston</a>.</li>
<li>Playground on Tremont:
We found a much smaller playground between the Hotel and NEMC that
Kavi and Anika liked a little better, mostly because they had it all
to themselves.</li>
<li>Playgrounds on the Charles River:
Take the bridge over to the Hatch shell, go left (west) and walk for
about half a mile. Nestled between Storrow Drive and the Charles
River, there&rsquo;s plenty to watch and play with. Kavi and Anika really
liked the little car. Oh, and if you happen to go right (east)
instead of left, there&rsquo;s a great playground near the tennis
courts, which is on the way to the Museum of Science. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hatchshell.com/">Hatch shell</a>:
There was an AIDS race while we were there which meant lots of people and
balloons to keep the kids occupied. I heard it gets crazy on July
4th :-)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mos.org/">Museum of Science</a>:
Aside from the annoying registration employee, this was fun. The
<a href="http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/current_exhibits&amp;d=233">Discovery   Center</a>
didn&rsquo;t open for an hour, so we explored the regular museum
first. Most of it was above Kavi and Anika&rsquo;s age level, so they were
getting bored/overwhelmed. The Discovery Center was better, though we
didn&rsquo;t find the best part (the upstairs level) until near the end of
our stay. Kavi&rsquo;s favorite thing was watching the pneumatic tube
system. The volunteers up there were really engaging as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bostonkids.org/exhibits.html">Children&rsquo;s Museum</a>:
The museum with the &ldquo;rabbit sitting on top&rdquo; and the big milk
bottle on the side. Predictably loved by Kavi and Anika.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.neaq.org">New England Aquarium</a>:
The kids were underwhelmed. They liked the
<a href="http://www.vanaqua.org/">Vancouver</a> and
<a href="http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/">Atlanta</a> ones more. We spent most
of our time in the toddler area playing with toys that are normally
found in doctors&rsquo; waiting rooms. I think they&rsquo;ll love this in a
couple years. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://mbta.com">The T</a>:
We could have just ridden the T every day. It was loud, which freaks
Kavi out a bit, but not as loud as New York. We rode on the blue
line to get to the aquarium, and the Green line to come back to the
Hotel. He especially liked the Green line because the &ldquo;floor turns&rdquo;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bostonparkplaza.com/">Park Plaza</a>:
A decent hotel. Living mostly on reputation and location. I guess
we&rsquo;ve been spoiled by modern hotels in other cities, so the Park
Plaza seemed dingy and overpriced. But the location is awesome, work was
paying for it, and our kids love any hotels, so I recommend it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dining">Dining:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vapiano (pseudo-italian restaurant where Bennigan&rsquo;s used to be):
The kids liked their pastas and like sitting at the little tables.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jaescafe.com/">Jae&rsquo;s Cafe</a>:
Not really a kids thing, but we went early on a weeknight and had a
really nice dinner. They have &ldquo;training&rdquo; chopsticks that the kids loved.

<li><a href="http://www.mikescitydiner.com/">Mike&rsquo;s City Diner</a>: (Ouch, Flashy website)
Our first breakfast stop and we returned a few days later which is a
huge endorsement. Avoid it on weekends though, because it&rsquo;s
packed. Cash only. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->

Another great breakfast place. We went on Kavi&rsquo;s birthday and were
just about the only ones in the restaurant, so the entire staff sang
Happy Birthday and put a candle on his pancake. He was so
thrilled. Cash only.

<li>Legal Seafood:
Quick dinner after arriving from the airport. Not the most kid
friendly place, but aside from a long wait, it was fine.

<li>Dunkin Donuts:
Nostalgic coffee and donuts, but NO BATHROOMS!</li>

The best salt &amp; pepper squid that I have ever had. Still as good as
I remember it 15 years ago! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<li>Dim Sum at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/hei-la-moon-boston">Hei La Moon</a>:
Mala was at her meeting, Anika was asleep and Kavi was sick, so only
I got to enjoy this luxury.

<li>North End (Boston&rsquo;s Little Italy):
We went to visit Mala&rsquo;s friends and had great take out. The walk
from the Park Plaza was nice, since it crossed the Garden, the
government center area and the North End, all of which had sights
that the kids enjoyed</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/croissant-du-jour-boston">Croissant Du Jour</a>:
Great breakfast food and sandwiches.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.finaledesserts.com/">Finale</a>:
We went here for Kavi&rsquo;s birthday dessert. Nowhere near as good as I
remember it being, but that might be because Mala is just an amazing
cook, so my standards have risen. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->

Sandwiches are awesome! We went there on Monday, which is the day
that we eat only veggies, so I couldn&rsquo;t try the Regis that I used to
love. The bread, though, was enough to satisfy my cravings. Sit
outside and the kids will be entertained by the constant traffic and
activity on Boylston Street.</li>

<h3 id="useful-android-apps">Useful Android Apps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.yelp.android">Yelp</a>:
I downloaded a bunch of other ones including AAA Triptik, Tripadvisor,
HopStop, but I ended up using Yelp and Google Maps predominantly.</li>
<li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.tripit">TripIt</a>:
Not specific to Boston, but this app makes traveling easier. Keeps
track of all your flight info, hotel info and any other itinerary info
you want to stick into it.</li>
</ul>
<p>End result of the trip: Success!</p>
