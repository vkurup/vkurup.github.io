          <p>I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471827223/vinodkurupshomep">Quick Calculus: A Self-Teaching Guide, 2nd Edition</a> by Daniel Kleppner and Norman Ramsey. I found a few errors, but couldn&rsquo;t find an errata listing online, so I&rsquo;m documenting them here for future reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Page 107, Frame 206. The quotient rule as it&rsquo;s initially expressed is incorrect. The correct version is stated at the bottom of the page and also on page 102, Frame 194.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 173, Frame 330. None of the options listed are correct. The correct answer is 15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 187, Frame 355. The initial expression of Simpson&rsquo;s rule is confusing. It should be: <blockquote> <p> ∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> y dx = 2/6 Δ (y<sub>0</sub> + 4y<sub>1</sub> + y<sub>2</sub> + <span style="color: #ff0000;">y<sub>2</sub> +</span> 4y<sub>3</sub> + y<sub>4</sub> + &hellip; + y<sub>N-2</sub> + 4y<sub>N-1</sub> + y<sub>N</sub>) </p> </blockquote></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Errors in technical books annoy me because I spend way too much time trying to figure out why I&rsquo;m mixed up. Not having a published errata online annoys me even more. See <a href="http://borkware.com/corebook/errata">Mark&rsquo;s book</a> for an errata page done right.</p>
<p>All ranting aside, Quick Calculus is an ideal resource if you&rsquo;re looking to brush up on the basics of Calculus. It&rsquo;s short and interactive, yet it doesn&rsquo;t sugarcoat the material.</p>

<p><b>Thanks, I was thinking about getting Quick Calculus one of these days</b></p>
<p>
I read Pratical Algebra, another in this series. I am currently not
reading Geomery and Trigonomtry for Calculus, also in the series. I
really wish I had paid more attenion back when I took all these math
courses. That said, if you need to relearn math, those books work
well. I suspect the bits of Calculus I learned are still in my brain
somewhere, and just need to be put back together.

Hey Vin, I checked out your pics from your family reunion and
everybody looks the same, your parents haven't aged a bit and Mini and
Manu haven't changed either, you may have put on a few pounds but who
hasn't.  It's hard to believe how big your nieces and nephews are
getting. It looks like everybody had a great time.  Hey also if you're
going to be in town soon and you've got the time, we should get
together and catch up on things.

          <p>Researchers at my alma mater have shown that <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/9208.html">mice who have been bred to run long distances show increased activity in &lsquo;craving&rsquo; regions of the brain when they&rsquo;re denied access to their running wheel</a> (Be sure to check out the Quicktime video on that page). The addiction of running is physiologically similar to other addictions. Maybe that explains why I was out on the East River Path in 29 degree weather tonight.</p>

I found that article very interesting Vinu.  I don't know if it is

cardiovascular excercise I often feel highly restless.  It's all one

          <p>I ran two more races this past week - the <a href="http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a31123&amp;result.year=2003">Race to Deliver 4 mile</a> in Central Park on Sunday and the <a href="http://pptc.org/gallery/2003_pptc_turkey_trot/2003_turkey_trot_gallery_01.php">Turkey Trot 5 mile</a> in <a href="http://www.prospectpark.org/index.cfm">Prospect Park</a> yesterday. The Race to Deliver was crowded with 6000 or so other runners and I spent most of the first half of the race just swerving around everyone else. I never quite got into a groove, but I was still able to finish in 32:34.</p>
<p>The Turkey Trot was much more fun. The first half mile was crowded, but the rest of the race was smooth sailing. I&rsquo;d never been to Prospect Park before and I was pleasantly surprised by its beauty. New York City is certainly blessed with great public parks. Anyway, I ran the last 2 miles in 15 minutes to finish in 40:12. I hope to break the 8 minute barrier soon&hellip;</p>

          <p>I ran the <a href="http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a31116&amp;result.year=2003">NYRR Cross Country Championships</a> this AM in 26:48 for 5K. My last cross country race was 15 years ago as a senior in high school. Wow, writing that sentence makes me feel old :-) In those days, I could run 5K in 19 minutes easily and I thought that 7 minute miles were slow. Ahh, to be young again! The NYRR run is held at Van Cortland Park, a beautiful oasis in the Bronx and the race starts out deceptively flat. You run along the edge of the some soccer fields for the first mile and then enter into a forest where nothing but steep unrelenting hills await you. I did great on the flat part! The hills kinda killed me, but I&rsquo;m happy to report that I fought off strong urges to walk up some of the nearly vertical hills around mile 2. I gotta thank Harish for pushing me through a grueling 9 mile workout last weekend which left me on the edge of death, but gave me the confidence to keep running today! Finally, near the end of the hills, I started to feel stronger and the next thing I knew we were out of the woods and circling around the starting line where the women&rsquo;s race was getting ready to begin (had to pick it up there!). I turned the corner to the finish and started my sprint which was longer than I expected. I was about to pack it in and coast to the finish line when I saw that the clock was nearing 27. Gotta break 27, gotta break 27! Woo hoo!   This may just be some residual endorphins talking, but I&rsquo;m gonna break 20 minutes for 5K again someday.</p>

Hey Vin, maybe you should train with P. Diddy he seemed to post an

training.

          <p>I ran the <a href="http://marinemarathon.com">Marine Corps Marathon</a> yesterday
and can now confirm that <a href="http://www.badwaterultra.com/training/bane.html">Hitting the Wall</a> is a real
phenomenon. I finished about 5 minutes faster than I did in Chicago
(2000), but I was really hoping to break 4:30. Everything was going
great through the halfway point (2:11:48 - 10:04 mpm) when a few
doubts started to creep into my head. I&rsquo;m only halfway? I gotta do
this again? Somehow I was able to make it through to mile 17 at
2:55:30 (10:19 mpm) before things really fell apart. I remember it
clearly yesterday and it seemed to be an instant replay from
Chicago. I started thinking about how much further I had to go and how
tired I already was. Then I think, well, maybe I need to rest up so I
can finish strong, huh? Maybe I should walk through the next water
break - that won&rsquo;t be such a bad thing, right? And then the next thing
I know, I&rsquo;m walking more than I&rsquo;m running. Once I start walking, I&rsquo;m
done. The key is not to think about how much further you have to go,
but rather to take it one step at a time, but that&rsquo;s obviously easier
said than done. The marathon is not a rational thing - if you think
about it and you let your rational mind make decisions for you, you&rsquo;ll
never accomplish your goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still quite happy with finishing. I&rsquo;m sore all over, but in that
satisfying kinda way. I was able to take the train home yesterday and
even made it to work today. And unlike 2000, I&rsquo;m motivated to keep
running, although I&rsquo;m going to stay away from marathoning for a
while. My left brain isn&rsquo;t ready for it.</p>

<p><b>Metaphor of life</b></p>
<p>
Hi Vinu,  Congratulations on the race.  I fully agree with everything
you said.  You know what I thought about the Marathon that I ran in
Chicago... it is really a metaphor of life... just like you said
taking things step by step.  I saw an advertisement of the Boston
Marathon I think that went something like this... there is nothing you
can't learn about yourself that you can't learn in 26.2 miles.  I was
really amazed at the diversity of people who were runnng.  There were
people who really looked out of shape running at a significantly
faster pace that I could imagine they could run.  I remember a guy
dressed up in a clown suit passing me up and the two guys that ran
with me most of the way.  One of the guys said "we can't let a clown
pass us" to which the other replied "oh yes we can."  I do agree that
the marathon takes a lot out of you both mentally and physically.  My
knees still ache a bit when I run.  I don't know though, it can
certainly be addictive.  I look forward to seeing you to talk about
our marathon experiences.

          <p>Dilu and Amit raced 26.2 miles in the <a href="http://chicagomarathon.com">Chicago Marathon</a> today and both finished with amazing times. Dilu completed his first marathon in 4:19:18 which is less than 10 minute miles and almost an hour better than my first one. Amit ran the 2000 Chicago Marathon with me and finished in 4:30ish, I think. He ran today in 3:57:32 - breaking that elusive 4 hr barrier. Nice job guys!</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m excited for the <a href="http://marinemarathon.com">Marine Corps Marathon</a> - 2 weeks to go. I&rsquo;ll never be able to match Amit and Dilu, but I&rsquo;m going to try to beat my Chicago time of 5:13:30.</p>

Sorry MarkD, but you're clearly slumming it here. Anyone who has had

book reviewed on Slashdot</a> has already reached the pinnacle of
coolness.

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p><a href="http://www.veshman.com/mt/index.php">Bhavesh</a> responded to my <a href="http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=9513">seemingly irrational exuberance about OpenACS</a> asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the excitement about OpenACS?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are much better answers to this question, starting with <a href="http://www.acornhosting.com/whyoacs">Why OpenACS?</a>, by my web host <a href="http://www.acornhosting.com/">Cathy Sarisky</a>, but here&rsquo;s my super brief answer.</p>
<p>OpenACS is a toolkit to build online communities, that is, sites which value  users and their contributions. OpenACS provides applications which allow users to create and manage content - applications like forums, photo albums, blogs, calendars, wikis, and file storage areas. Users can obviously create content in these areas, but they can also be given extra privileges to moderate the content or grant privileges to others. So, administrators can delegate the management of the site to those who are most invested in it - the community. Currently, OpenACS&rsquo;s main focus has been at <a href="http://dotlrn.org/">educational  institutions</a> (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html">the University of Heidelberg</a>, and many others) where it&rsquo;s ideally suited for course management. It&rsquo;s currently not polished enough to be used out-of-the-box unless you&rsquo;re comfortable with Linux system adminstration, but <a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=117914">improvements are being made in that area</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://kurup.org/content/site-info">This site is built on OpenACS</a>, but I barely scratch the surface of the features available. I plan to add more stuff soon, but <a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=125253">OpenACS is in the midst of releasing its next version</a>, so I&rsquo;m concentrating my extensive free time in that endeavor. Once OpenACS 5 is out, I&rsquo;ll upgrade this site and then add some of the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure that OpenACS is the right application if you&rsquo;re just looking to build a personal website. <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> is much more suited to that purpose. OpenACS is useful when you want to allow a <strong>bunch of users</strong> to each have <strong>complete control</strong> over their own personal websites, yet also allow those users to interact with each other, perhaps even aggregating content from multiple users in one place. So, if you wanted to create a service that competed with <a href="http://blogs.com/">TypePad</a>, you could use OpenACS to do that.</p>
<p>OpenACS&rsquo;s main power lies in the fine-grained control that it gives you. Every object and area can be controlled the way you want, so the level of control that users have is up to you. The database API is clean and gives you full access to the database of your choice - Oracle or PostgreSQL. Your hands aren&rsquo;t tied. The templating system is intuitive yet offers a lot of features for more complex, specific cases if needed. A lot of work is currently going into building and improving an automated testing framework. There are plenty of other reasons why I love OpenACS and I&rsquo;ll write about them some more as examples of them come up.</p>
<p>In short, OpenACS is the way for me to get things done on the web.</p>

What I really like about it is that it has the common data model.  The
same user features, the same content features, are available
everywhere.  Try to glue together a PHP forum and a PHP shopping cart
made by two different groups and you're in for a good deal of work.
<p>I&rsquo;m also a fan of esoteric technologies.  I like using tools that work
well (Macs, postgresql, aolserver, qmail) rather than the tools
everyone uses, since the popular tools are usually extremely
feature-rich, but ugly as sin on the inside (Windows, Apache,
sendmail)</p>

The consistent user-centered datamodel is key. I think some joker
wrote an <a
href="http://macedition.com/bolts/bolts_20030207.php">excellent
article about OpenACS and its strong points.</a> I really meant to
point to that article in my post, since it succintly describes
everything that I was trying to say. :-)
