          <p>I&rsquo;ve been getting weird emails over the past day or so. The <code>From:</code> address is always different, there is no body text and there is an attachment called <code>your_document.pif</code>. The <code>From:</code> address is sometimes recognizable, but seems to be spoofed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=your_document.pif">Google only gave me 1 document for &ldquo;your_document.pif&rdquo;</a> and that document states that <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/sobig_f.shtml">this is a new virus called W32/Sobig.F-mm</a> (link changed due to 404). Not much info about it yet, but it seems pretty widespread.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Wow, google only had 1 document for the above search when I wrote this a few hours ago and now it has 391! Looks like this virus is just taking off. <a href="http://www.local6.com/news/2420899/detail.html">Fastest. Virus. Ever.</a></p>

          <p>The power finally came back on at around 7:20 PM tonight. I was
sitting on my futon trying as hard as I could not to sweat, when I
heard a loud cheer from the courtyard and saw that the lights had gone
on in the apartments outside my window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a weird couple of days. The power went out around 4:15 PM
yesterday while I was looking up some labs in the preceptor&rsquo;s
room. The A/C had been on full-blast, so we all thought that it was
just an overloaded circuit, but soon we got word that nearby buildings
were affected and everyone went smoothly into disaster-mode. Take care
of any urgent patient needs and encourage everyone else to go home. No
staff leaves until we know what&rsquo;s going on. Around 6:30, we got the
word that whoever was within walking distance could go home, provided
that they be back first thing in the morning. I figured 4 miles is
walking-distance, so I left. From the 80&rsquo;s to around 63rd St, 2nd
Avenue was packed with cars trying in vain to get to the Queensboro
bridge. Traffic lights were off, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter since
the cars weren&rsquo;t moving anyway. Civilians were trying to direct
traffic with varying success. The cars obeyed, but pedestrians were on
their own schedule. From the Queensboro down to the 40&rsquo;s, pedestrians
replaced the cars and swarmed over the street.</p>
<p>I got to my neighborhood around 8ish. Most of the local shops were out
of flashlights and running low on water. I swear the people at the
counter were just making up prices as they went along, but no one
really seemed to care. After getting settled at home, I went for a
short walk outside around 10PM. I was shocked at how dark New York was
without any lights. You could clearly see the stars in the sky. It was
dangerous to walk around without a flashlight because there would be
people just sitting on the sidewalk waiting to be tripped over.</p>
<p>But everything is back to normal now and the only casualty is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime">uptime</a></p>

          <p>An article in the NY Times claims that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/science/12MAIL.html">&lsquo;6 degrees of separation&rsquo; is an exaggeration</a>. They tested it by asking people to forward emails to people that they knew in hopes that the chain would eventually lead to 1 of the researchers&rsquo; destinations. I know that I delete any chain mail that I get, so I&rsquo;m not sure that the study&rsquo;s results are valid.</p>
<p>Let me provide an anecdotal rebuttal. I went to <a href="http://www.archana-subhasis.us/">Subha and Archana&rsquo;s wedding</a> in Chicago last weekend and I&rsquo;m guessing there were 400 people there. I met about 20 people whom I hadn&rsquo;t met before. Of those, 2 had links to me through people who had nothing to do with the wedding. One was a cousin of Sushil, my good buddy from Boston. The other one is a little more convoluted. My cousin Deepu was the inspiration for the name of a musical group when he was at Wash U in St. Louis. Deepu has since moved on to San Fran, so the group has changed its name. A person I met at the wedding is currently a member of that group and has always wanted to meet the infamous Deepu, whose name is plastered over the other members&rsquo; instruments.</p>
<p>Now, does being connected through a band&rsquo;s name count as a degree of separation?</p>

          <p>Another interesting article in the Times today. Lo and behold, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/health/12PHYS.html">annual physical exam</a> is useless. Shocking, huh? Well, no - not really. The first <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=7030166&amp;dopt=Citation">questions about the annual physical</a> cropped up 20 years ago and recent studies have only confirmed these initial doubts.</p>
<p>So, do I perform annual physicals? Yup. Why? A few reasons&hellip;. As a relatively young doc, I think it&rsquo;s important to examine <strong>LOTS and LOTS</strong> of normal patients in order to get a firm sense of what&rsquo;s normal and what&rsquo;s abnormal. And even if I were 100% confident in my physical exam, I would still want to keep those exam skills sharp.</p>
<p>The annual physical is also a great time, if not the only time, to discuss preventive care with patients. Acute care visits are already rushed and sick patients aren&rsquo;t the most receptive listeners.</p>
<p>Patients in my community are underserved as it stands - getting rid of annual physicals would only contribute to patients getting lost in the system.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, performing annual physicals makes me look like a doctor. Patients expect annual physicals and I&rsquo;d look like a quack if I didn&rsquo;t perform them, regardless of how much science is backing me up. This is one of those classic &ldquo;Art of Medicine/Science of Medicine&rdquo; intersections. In order to be able to practice the Science of Medicine effectively, we need to compromise on the scientific purity a bit, for the sake of the Art of Medicine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I still listen to everyone&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said Dr. Stewart Rogers, an internist at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. &ldquo;Why pick that fight? Why try to explain 10 years of evidence-based medicine so the patient will understand why I didn&rsquo;t do that test? The reason to listen to hearts is that it establishes our priestly majesty when you tell them about smoke alarms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, I do try to explain to patients that not all tests are necessary and can in fact be harmful, but I&rsquo;m not dogmatic about it.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>It was pouring, monsoon-style here in NYC today, but I went running anyway. When it&rsquo;s raining, no one else is out, so I get the path to myself. And jumping over (or through) the puddles makes me feel like a tough guy. I swear I can hear the Rocky theme song when I run in the rain. The only bad thing about running in the rain is that the always-stunning midtown skyline gets obscured by the clouds.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t run outside since July 13th when my knee started hurting. I&rsquo;ve run on the treadmill a couple times this week and my knee felt fine, so I decided to hit the pavement today. I ran to the East River and all the way down to the South Street Seaport. About 8 miles in 90 minutes. My knee was a little sore at the end but it feels fine now.</p>

          <p>A young guy came in as a walk-in with some mild shortness of breath on exertion and associated chest pain. He was the last patient that I saw during a long, busy day and his symptoms were very mild. I was thinking that maybe he had mild asthma or a respiratory infection, but he didn&rsquo;t look sick at all. Then I listened to his heart. A loud holosystolic murmur throughout with a fixed split S2. Wait, wait. I know this one&hellip;. (sounds of my mind clunking along) ASD - <a href="http://www.heartpoint.com/congasd.html">Atrial Septal Defect</a> (<a href="http://www.ucsfhealth.org/childrens/medical_services/heart_center/congenital/conditions/atrial/signs.html">Patient Information</a>).</p>
<p>He had his echocardiogram today which confirmed that he had a large ASD (We don&rsquo;t need no stinking echo!). He&rsquo;ll be going to Bellevue for repair and most likely will do very well. I explained everything to him (in Spanish &ldquo;un agujero in su corazón&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s times like these that make me glad that I get to do what I do.</p>
