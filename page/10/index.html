  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I use <a href="http://www.kinodv.org/">kino</a> to edit the
<a href="http://youtube.com/vkurup1">videos that we take of the kids</a>. I haven&rsquo;t
found a Linux program which was as nice as iMovie was on the Mac, but kino
is pretty good. It&rsquo;s easy to splice and reconnect video clips together. It
has nice special effects, though my needs are pretty simple. It&rsquo;s able to
export in plenty of formats, possibly too many, for my simple mind. But,
I&rsquo;ve figured it out and have a stable process for getting video from camera
to youtube.</p>
<p>I have 3 camcorders - a <a href="http://www.theflip.com/">Flip</a>, my Canon digital
camera, and a Panasonic DVD camcorder. I can just copy the AVI files
directly off the Flip and the Canon&rsquo;s SD card. The Panasonic records all of
the video clips into a single file with a .VRO extension. I found a great
utility called <a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/programs/dvd-vr/">dvd-vr</a>, which
reads that file and splits it into individual AVI files. Once I have a
directory full of AVI files from the various camcorders, I use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> to rename them consistently. I
open up 2 buffers: an editable dired buffer (<code>wdired-change-to-wdired-mode</code>)
of the movies directory, and a shell buffer in that same directory. I run a
macro which takes the first file in the directory, plays it via an mplayer
command in the shell buffer and then renames the file using the
date/timestamp of the file. The macro leaves the cursor in a spot where I
can enter a brief description of the video and then run the macro again to
do the next video. It works pretty well. I then batch convert them to DV
format, which is what Kino accepts. Finally, I launch Kino and edit the
files, add titles, export them to AVI again, and then upload them to
youtube.</p>
<p>I did this today and ran into a problem with kino. The video played at
breakneck speed and there was no audio. Google helped me figure out that
this was a problem between PulseAudio and kino. Kino is no longer actively
developed. The lead developer considers it stable and finished and he&rsquo;s
moved on to other endeavors, which is perfectly understandable. He&rsquo;s
however, taken the time to describe
<a href="http://www.kinodv.org/article/view/173/1/13/">a workaround</a>. He recommends
running <code>padsp kino</code> which routes all audio requests from kino to
pulseaudio. This worked, but the audio had a lot of feedback. I found an
even better
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8367831&amp;postcount=7">workaround on the ubuntu forums</a>. Use
<code>pasuspender kino</code>, which suspends all PulseAudio activity, gives kino
direct access to audio devices, and then resumes PulseAudio once kino has
quit. This worked with perfect audio quality, though of course, audio from
any other program gets muted completely.</p>
<p>I am still on the lookout for a better video editing solution on
Linux. Eventually, I&rsquo;d like to make DVDs of the hundreds of little clips
that I have. They don&rsquo;t need to be fancy, but I would like to have some
basic menus and they need to work on standard DVD players. I&rsquo;ve started
doing a little research on this, so will post once I&rsquo;ve tried some things
out.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>If you asked me a few years ago, I would have said you absolutely can&rsquo;t
time the stock market. The 2008 crash hurt enough to make me review my
convictions a little. I still believe that accurate market timing is
somewhere between difficult and impossible. Trying to analyze stock charts
to figure out what will happen in the short term is mostly a crap
shoot. The way to win in the stock market is to buy value stocks,
especially when everyone else is selling.</p>
<p>I do, however, now believe that there is a place for market timing in
deciding when to be in the stock market, in the first place. I think there
are some trends that have repeatedly predicted poor stock
performance. There are some super smart people that have analyzed these
trends over at the <a href="http://boards.fool.com">Motley Fool message boards</a>. They&rsquo;ve come up with many indicators that
supposedly tell you when to get in and out of the stock market, but my
favorite is the <a href="http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=27442724">99 day rule</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the 99 day rule is that when the
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EGSPC">S&amp;P 500 Index</a> stops making new highs,
investors get pessimistic and stocks fall. When it starts making new highs
again, optimism takes over and bull markets start. The 99 day rule has 2
parts and coincidentally uses 99 days as the cut-off for both parts. It
looks at whether a new high has been made recently. It defines &ldquo;high&rdquo; as a
99-day high. It defines &ldquo;recently&rdquo; as 99 days. So, it looks for a new
99-day high within the last 99 days. The number is arbitrary. Hop over the
the
<a href="http://boards.fool.com/mechanical-investing-100093.aspx">Motley Fool boards</a>
to see how the dates have been tuned and pick different ones, if you like.</p>
<p>I like this rule, because it&rsquo;s simple, easy to calculate and doesn&rsquo;t have
many &ldquo;signals&rdquo;, so you&rsquo;re not constantly buying and selling. Of course,
it&rsquo;s not perfect, but it would have gotten you out of most of the major
bear markets.</p>
<p>Here is how the rule has done over time:</p>
<pre><code>Period        S&amp;P 500   Switching   Improvement 
---------     -------   ---------   -----------
1930-1935     -12.2%       4.3%       16.4% 
1935-1940      10.3%      16.2%        6.0% 
1940-1945       7.4%       5.6%       -1.8% 
1945-1950      10.2%       7.4%       -2.8% 
1950-1955      23.6%      22.5%       -1.1% 
1955-1960      15.2%      13.8%       -1.4% 
1960-1965      10.7%      11.7%        1.0% 
1965-1970       5.0%       7.1%        2.2% 
1970-1975      -2.4%       6.8%        9.2% 
1975-1980      14.8%      12.0%       -2.8% 
1980-1985      14.8%      20.1%        5.2% 
1985-1990      20.4%      18.8%       -1.7% 
1990-1995       8.7%       6.7%       -2.0% 
1995-2000      28.6%      27.9%       -0.7% 
2000-2005      -2.3%       4.3%        6.6% 
2005-early2008  2.0%       4.5%        2.5%
</code></pre>
<p>You may have gotten to this point and are now wondering why it&rsquo;s worth
following this rule. In at least 3 of the past 5 periods, this signal would
have lost money versus staying in the market. That is true. The key is to
understand that there is no free lunch. Any rule that tries to get you out
of major bear markets will be imperfect and will often leave you with less
money than if you had chosen to act on a different date (or not act at
all). The overall goal is not to increase your returns, but to decrease
your risk without sacrificing your returns. This signal does that. Overall,
it does actually increase your returns by about 2% annually since 1930.</p>
<p>The other nice feature is that it doesn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;slam-dunk&rdquo; feel to it. My
experience is that things that work in the stock market have to have a
little of a &ldquo;gut wrenching&rdquo; feel to them. If it sounds too good to be true,
it is. This rule feels correct, improves returns over the long run, is
backtested well, but does so at the risk of some lower performing
years. That feels a little gut-wrenching to me.</p>
<p>Here is the author&rsquo;s (<a href="http://www.stonewellfunds.com/">mungofitch</a>) description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By using the rule that I described above, you would have had
a total return of 11.80%, with a total risk of 6.71%. So, you
would have had 2.3% per year higher returns on average,
while experiencing only about 56.9% of the risk.
Higher returns, lower risk. That sounds good, right?</p>
<p>But, is this one of those iffy timing systems that really only works
because it managed to avoid the crash of 1987 of something?
No, actually it has you in the market in the 1987 crash: it&rsquo;s
not perfect. But does it really add value on average through the years?
Not always, but pretty darned well. Sometimes you do a little worse,
but never a lot worse. And when you do better, you do a LOT better.
So, overall, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to keep track of the signal, I wrote a <a href="http://github.com/vkurup/ninety-nine">little python program</a> to calculate whether we are
in buy mode or sell mode. It uses the excellent <a href="http://www.goldb.org/ystockquote.html">ystockquote module</a> written by Corey Goldberg.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>As mentioned yesterday, I&rsquo;m teaching myself clojure. I started by trying to
install it.</p>
<pre><code>vinod@ike$ aptitude install clojure
</code></pre>
<p>Ubuntu has packaged version 1.0.0 of clojure. I always default to the
OS-installed version of programs, just for ease of maintenance. The current
stable version of clojure is 1.1 and it appears that 1.2 is in beta. I have
no idea what has been changed in 1.1 or 1.2, but I&rsquo;m going to try to get
along using 1.0.0 and update only if I need to for a specific reason.</p>
<p>I then read through the
<a href="http://www.moxleystratton.com/article/clojure/for-non-lisp-programmers">tutorial for non-lisp programmers</a>,
which succinctly describes the basics of the language.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Everything in
lisp is either an atom or a list. Atoms include numbers, booleans, strings,
symbols, keywords and the nil value. Lists (delimited by parentheses <code>()</code>)
are the basic data structure, but include representations such as vectors
(delimited by square brackets <code>[]</code>) and maps (delimited by curly brackets
<code>{}</code>). Clojure programs are themselves simply lists, which leads to the
power of lisp-like languages because code and data are interchangeable.</p>
<p>You use <code>def</code> to create variables and <code>defn</code> to create functions. The
language includes loops and conditional statements, just like any other
useful language. Only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are <em>false</em> in clojure; zero (0),
and the empty string (&quot;&quot;) are <em>true</em>, unlike a lot of languages.</p>
<p>The interesting part is the integration with Java. To instantiate a java
object, simply call <code>new</code>:</p>
<pre><code>user=&gt; (new java.util.Date)
#&lt;Date Sun Jul 18 16:20:54 EDT 2010&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To call object methods or get instance/class variables, use the dot &ldquo;.&rdquo;
method.</p>
<pre><code>user=&gt; (. (new java.util.Date) (toString))
&quot;Sun Jul 18 16:24:09 EDT 2010&quot;

user=&gt; (. Integer MAX_VALUE)
2147483647
</code></pre>
<p>The article contains this interesting quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sequences are in a sense, the core of idiomatic Clojure
programming. Understand sequences and the forms that work with them, and
you will have cleared one of the biggest hurdles in writing significant
Clojure programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, add that to my to-do list. Where to go next? A
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/599519/which-tutorial-on-clojure-is-best">StackOverflow thread</a>
has pointed to me to a few options. I&rsquo;ll probably read one of these next:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>I later read that this tutorial is out of date, so I may have to &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; things later. It still comes up as the first hit on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=clojure+tutorial">Google for &ldquo;clojure tutorial&rdquo;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

          <p>Steve Yegge is one of my favorite bloggers. I read <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">&ldquo;You Should Write Blogs&rdquo;</a> a
long time ago and it is one of the main reasons that I still try to keep
this blog going at all. He recently took a blogging hiatus and in his
<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2010/07/blogger-finger.html">return post</a>,
he left a little hint that he was interested in a programming language
called <a href="http://clojure.org">clojure</a>.</p>
<p>My programming skills have been rusting away (Darn those patients, always
getting sick and stuff!), so I&rsquo;ve been looking for a little
inspiration. I&rsquo;m hoping that clojure is it. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn
lisp. I know a little elisp and scheme, but I&rsquo;ve never gotten comfortable
with them. Clojure compiles code that runs on a JVM (java virtual
machine). This gives you a lot of the &ldquo;power&rdquo; of java, namely the extensive
libraries and the widespread platforms on which it will run. But instead of
having to write java, you get to write in a dynamic, lisp-like language. At
least that&rsquo;s how I understand it.</p>
<p>Specifically, I hope that I&rsquo;ll eventually be able to create applications
that run on android phones, which is a java environment. Smartphones are
clearly going to be a huge part of the future, if not <strong>the way</strong> of the
future. I don&rsquo;t see myself ever buying an iPhone and Mala already has a
Droid Eris that I&rsquo;d be able to play with if I needed. (Didn&rsquo;t tell you
that, did I Mala?) So&hellip; Android it is.</p>
<p>Starting today, I&rsquo;m going to start reading about clojure and taking notes
(and maybe even posting them!). I&rsquo;ve never been very good about taking
notes, ever in my life. But, I clearly <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/03/how-to-brain-dump-what-you-know/">need to learn</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="http://inotify.aiken.cz/">incron</a> seems to be a pretty neat tool. It&rsquo;s
cron-for-file-activities. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a> is a
common unix tool that allows you to run any command at a specified
time. It&rsquo;s immensely useful for running anything that you want to occur on
a regular basis: backups, daily reminder emails, downloading podcasts,
etc. If you&rsquo;ve used unix to any significant extent, you&rsquo;ve used cron.</p>
<p>incron takes that cron metaphor and applies it to file activity. You
specify which files you want to watch, and then you specify which activities
you are interested in. If incron notices any of those activities occurring
on your files, it launches the command that you specified. Activities could
include creating a new file, modifying a file, accessing a file, among
multiple other possibilities. incron takes advantage of the inotify system
built into recent linux kernels, which supposedly is more efficient than
previous ways of doing this same thing.</p>
<p>incron seemed to be just what I wanted. I wanted to watch a specific
directory and launch a tool to rebuild my website if any of those files
changed. The problem is that incron doesn&rsquo;t work recursively on
directories. You have to specify each directory, the activities on that
directory, and the command to launch. If you create new directories, you
have to tell incron about them specifically. This ruins the benefit of the
tool for me. It seems the developer has been planning to implement
recursive watching for the past 4 years ago, but hasn&rsquo;t done it yet. If it
hasn&rsquo;t happened in 4 years, it&rsquo;s probably not going to happen soon.</p>
<p>But, I found a perfectly usable way to get what I
want. <a href="http://wiki.github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/">inotify-tools</a>
includes a program called <code>inotifywait</code>. It takes a file or directory name
and listens for specific activities that you are interested in. It
basically waits until it sees one of those activities and then returns
control back to you. So, you can something like (pseudocode):</p>
<pre><code>while (inotifywait /home/vinod/web/kurup.org):
    # triggered
    rebuild my server
</code></pre>
<p><code>inotifywait</code> waits for my activities. If it finds one, it returns TRUE and
my server gets rebuilt, and then the while loop restarts. Best of all,
<code>inotifywait</code> can work recursively on a directory. Which brings me to my
<code>watch-rebuild.sh</code> script which watches my web source files for changes,
and rebuilds the web generated files on demand. It also pops up a little
GNOME notification using <code>notify-send</code>:</p>

<p>DADDY and KAVI are lying next to each other in KAVI&rsquo;s bed doing their
bedtime ritual. They have finished singing a song and are recapping the
day.</p>
<p>DADDY: Did you play with playdoh today?</p>
<p>KAVI: No.</p>
<p>DADDY: Are you sure? Did you play with playdoh this morning before going to
the Puffin room?</p>
<p>(KAVI thinks)</p>
<p>KAVI: Yes. I did. Why did I play with playdoh?</p>
<p>DADDY: Because you wanted to. You asked me if you could play with it.</p>
<p>KAVI: Why did I want to play with the playdoh?</p>
<p>DADDY: I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>KAVI: Why you don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>DADDY: Because. I can&rsquo;t answer that question.</p>
<p>KAVI: Why you can&rsquo;t answer that question?</p>
<p>DADDY: It&rsquo;s a question of your motivation, KAVI. I can speculate about why
you wanted to play with the playdoh, but I can&rsquo;t tell you why you wanted
to.</p>
<p>(pause)</p>
<p>KAVI: Why?</p>
<p>DADDY: I can tell you what I want, but I can&rsquo;t tell you what you want.</p>
<p>KAVI: What do you want DADDY?</p>
<p>(DADDY takes a deep breath)</p>
<p>DADDY: A lot of things. I want you to grow up to be a strong, intelligent,
loving, happy boy. I want Anika to grow up to be a strong, intelligent,
loving, happy girl. I want Mommy to be able to do what she wants in life. I
want all of us to travel, spend time with family, and enjoy the world. That&rsquo;s
what I want.</p>
<p>KAVI: oh.</p>
<p>DADDY: What do you want?</p>
<p>KAVI: Playdoh.</p>

          <p>This is going to be a great year. I was working on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. My shift
was supposed to end at midnight, which meant that I would normally be home
around 12:30 AM, but my colleague let me out early since the ER was
unusually light. I got home at 11:55 PM, so I was able to kiss my beautiful
wife as the new year began. If that&rsquo;s not an auspicious start to a year, I
don&rsquo;t know what one would be.</p>
<p>I am so lucky. I have a great job, which is getting better all the time. I
work hard, but I get some pretty good karmic rewards. It&rsquo;s not perfect and
maybe someday I&rsquo;ll rant about the pitfalls of being a hospitalist, but it&rsquo;s
certainly better than my life was as a primary care doctor.</p>
<p>I live in a beautiful house where I feel comfortable and &ldquo;at home&rdquo;. I have
a loving extended family who, thankfully, are all pretty happy and healthy.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I have an amazing wife and 2 darling children who can
lift my heart into the heavens just by looking at me a certain way. They
can also make me feel completely unfit to be a father sometimes, but I
guess that&rsquo;s part of being a father. I have so much to teach them and they
have so much to teach me.</p>
<p>This is starting to feel like a &ldquo;Thanksgiving&rdquo; post rather than a &ldquo;New
Year&rsquo;s&rdquo; post. The bottom line is that I have a great feeling that this is
going to be a great year for me and my family.</p>

          <p>When Mala and I started looking for homes, we listed on a yellow notepad
all the things that were important to us. Like most little notes in my
life, it got lost. I found it a few days after we moved into our home and
was pleasantly surprised that we had gotten everything on our list, except
a lake view. Not bad, and there&rsquo;s a lake about a half mile from our
door. One of the things on that list that we &ldquo;kinda&rdquo; got was &ldquo;running
trails nearby&rdquo;. I say &ldquo;kinda&rdquo; because there is a trail which is just behind
the back of our property, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a running trail. It is a
paved trail which runs behind the houses in our neighborhood and extends
about 1 mile in total length. It is mostly through woods or along the lake,
so it&rsquo;s nice, but it&rsquo;s not a running trail. A running trail is not
paved. More importantly, a running trail goes for miles and miles, so that
you can feel like you are away from (sub)urban life.</p>
<p>So this was one of those things on our &ldquo;list&rdquo; that I would say we checked
off, but, not really, you know?</p>
<p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/vkurup/status/4533018776">went for a run</a> recently
and I can now say with certainty that this is my dream house. That paved
running trail which I had been so ambivalent about eventually ends at a
main road. And that&rsquo;s where I thought it ended. On Thursday, I crossed the
road and found a little mowed path which takes you to the local high
school. And then you take a right and WOW! A huge forest with a 10 foot
wide rock and dirt trail opens up in front of you. I started down this
trail, expecting it to end at someone&rsquo;s private property, but it kept going
and going and going. It ran next to a bubbling stream with water clear
enough to see the river&rsquo;s bottom. There were countless little paths snaking
away from the main one. I just kept running and it just got more and more
beautiful. I wish I had brought my camera. It felt like a religious
experience. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that this beautiful, seemingly endless trail</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of trail that I would have driven miles to get to in the past -
was in my backyard. I ended up running 11 miles, which is longer than I
have run since moving to North Carolina. I can&rsquo;t wait to run there
again. This is just another example of how I am the luckiest man in the
world. I always wanted to live in a house near trails like this, but didn&rsquo;t
think it was possible, so I settled for a little &ldquo;running trail&rdquo;. Just my
luck, it turns out to be the trail of my dreams :-)</li>
</ul>

          <p><em>A friend asked for some investing advice a few years ago. Here was my response.</em></p>
<p>I have a feeling this is going to be long&hellip; :-)</p>
<p>First thing - I don&rsquo;t know your exact financial situation, but I know
you&rsquo;re in great shape for the long run. Anyone thinking this seriously
about their finances this early in life will do fine. Also, since I don&rsquo;t
know much about your exact situation, this may be a little
&lsquo;condescending&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m sure you know I don&rsquo;t mean it that way. Just take what
you need from it and leave the rest. Also feel free to ask questions about
anything at any time. I love finances and it would be my pleasure to help
if there&rsquo;s any way that I can. I&rsquo;ve read A LOT of books and stuff, so it
would be nice to be of use to others.</p>
<p>The <strong>ABSOLUTE</strong> most important thing is to get out of debt. Nothing kills
your financial future more than debt. No matter how good of an investor you
are, you won&rsquo;t get anywhere if you don&rsquo;t take control of debt. Make that
your main focus. Until you are completely debt-free (except for a
mortgage), I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much time into investing. Have you heard of
<a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave Ramsey</a>? He has an excellent talk-radio
show about getting out of debt. It&rsquo;s a bit basic sometimes, and like all
talk-radio hosts, he&rsquo;s &ldquo;over-the-top&rdquo;, but he provides really useful
information. The most valuable thing about it is the repetition. Listeners
call in with their financial situation and he takes each one of them
through the same process. He calls them the Baby Steps, and they&rsquo;re really
just common sense, but listening to him walk listeners through them <em>over
and over</em> makes it stick in your head. He also advocates developing a
laser-like focus. Don&rsquo;t try to do a hundred things at once. Focus on <strong>one
thing</strong> at a time, whether it&rsquo;s paying off one credit card, or building up
an emergency fund, or whatever. Once that one thing is done, then move to
the next item. That simplifies life and is a better use of your energy than
trying to fix everything with little bits of your attention here and little
bits over there.</p>
<p>A book that everyone should read is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Millionaire Next Door<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which discusses the habits that financially
successful people share. It also focuses on getting out of debt and living
more simply. The advice seems pretty sound even though the methodology of
the book isn&rsquo;t. Taking a bunch of millionaires and finding out common
features among them <strong>is not</strong> good science.</p>
<p>All that said, thinking about investing at any time is a useful
endeavor. Just as long as you maintain your focus on getting out of debt.</p>
<p>The only people who should be investing in individual stocks are those who
enjoy it. If you don&rsquo;t relish reading financial statements and analyzing
stock valuations, then you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it. Life is too short. Do
stuff you enjoy and make your financial plan as simple as possible. Your
overall return will still be in the top 10-20% of all investors.</p>
<p>The most important part of investing is following a strict plan. And that
plan should be focused on asset allocation. What does that mean? There are
various classes of assets that you can invest in. The most common ones are
stocks, bonds, and real estate. Within each class, there are subclasses,
like small stocks, value stocks, international stocks, etc. It&rsquo;s almost
impossible to know which class will do well over the short term, even
though the talking heads on CNBC will tell you they think they
know. Studies show that it&rsquo;s a toss up. So, the smartest thing to do is to
look at the long term return of each asset class (past 20-50 years), decide
what percent of your portfolio you want to place in each class, and then
<strong>STICK WITH IT THROUGH THICK AND THIN</strong>. That is capitalized because that
is the most important part. If you constantly adjust your percentages
because you &ldquo;think&rdquo; large tech stocks are going to start doing well, then
you will kill this approach. Everyone thought tech stocks were going to do
well in 1999. 2000 killed them. My favorite book describing this strategy
and the rationale behind it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Random Walk Down Wall Street<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Burton Malkiel.</p>
<p>Once you decide what your asset classes should be and what percentages you
want to invest in each (I can help you with suggestions), then you find a
<strong>LOW COST</strong> index fund (or ETF) that tracks that asset class and buy the
appropriate amount. Then just leave it alone until next year. Look at the
results and if one or more asset classes has gotten out of whack with your
desired percentages, then rebalance. Sell a little of the one which has
gotten too big and buy a little of the one that has gotten too small.</p>
<p>This way, you are automatically selling an asset class AFTER it has risen
and buying an asset class when it has been beaten down. You&rsquo;re buying low
and selling high.</p>
<p>For someone who wanted the simplest possible investment plan, I would
recommend putting 75% of their portfolio into a broad stock fund (VFINX or
VTSMX) and 25% into a simple low-cost bond fund (VBMFX). Then just
rebalance every year. But you can also make this more complex by splitting
the stock portion into domestic and international, then small and large
companies, etc. It can be as complex as you want; just be sure to keep it
consistent from year to year. That is the key which will allow you to buy
assets when they are at their low point and sell them when they are high.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to invest in individual stocks, I&rsquo;d recommend keeping it
to a small portion of your overall portfolio (&lt; 10%). Figuring out how to
value stocks is an art that takes a lifetime. The one book that I&rsquo;d
recommend is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Intelligent Investor<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Benjamin Graham. It was written decades ago,
but it gives the groundwork necessary to understand how to invest in
stocks.</p>
<p>In order to really successfully invest in individual stocks, you need to be
able to identify companies that have a sustainable competitive
advantage. This is something that I have a lot of trouble with and haven&rsquo;t
really pursued enough. This is what Warren Buffett does. If you really want
to understand this process, read everything on <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html">this page</a>.</p>
<p>This email is getting a bit long. So let me know if what I scribbled is
understandable and if you have any questions. There&rsquo;s more trivia locked up
in this brain of mine, if you want more :-)</p>

          <p>I love watching Kavi&rsquo;s expressions. We took the kids to the <a href="http://www.ncmls.org/">Museum of Life and Science</a> for a birthday party today. He&rsquo;s been
there plenty of times, mostly with Mala. I&rsquo;ve been there a few times with
him. It&rsquo;s one of his (and I guess every kid&rsquo;s) favorite places. Each time
we go, it&rsquo;s a vastly different experience. Everything seems new to him. His
eyes light up with wonder and amazement at the exhibits.</p>
<p>We were late for the party, so Mala took Anika ahead of us while Kavi
dawdled in the front exhibits. Ahead of us was a large skeleton of a
dinosaur&rsquo;s head. I know that he has seen this before, but, it was as if
he&rsquo;d noticed it for the first time today. And it was scary. Not too scary,
mind you. He wasn&rsquo;t crying or anything. He just was very cautious about
getting too close to it. But, there was no way to avoid it, since the party
room (with the cake!) was just past the dinosaur. He held my hand tightly
and asked what it was. I told him and he repeated it, &ldquo;Dinosaur?&rdquo;. His eyes
were wide open, but focused on the T-Rex&rsquo;s head. His right hand clenched my
left and when I tried to walk past it, he pulled me back. Still no crying
or complaining, just &hellip; concern. So I took my time and talked to him about
the dinosaur and the other exhibits nearby. Eventually, he mustered up the
courage to walk around the back of the dinosaur and towards the party
room. Later, after the cake and festivities, we made our way back to the
other exhibits. This time, he pointed out the dinosaur, still in a
concerned voice, but made no effort to shy away or slow down. Now, he
noticed other things that he had missed before &ndash; cool astronauts uniforms
and a glass elevator slowly ascending. When he saw each of these things,
his face turned into the embodiment of wonder. Eyes wide open, jaw slightly
ajar. I love seeing him experience life like this, so fully.</p>
<p>I write this because I know that I&rsquo;m otherwise going to forget them. I had
the distinct feeling this afternoon, while watching him, that he was
growing up in front of my eyes. That these expressions of wonderment would
soon be replaced by the apathy of young adulthood. I know, I know&hellip; he&rsquo;s
only 2, but everyone keeps telling me that he will be grown and with kids
of his own before I know it! I hope not and if so, I hope not <em>too soon</em>. I
want to make sure that I remember these moments, simply for their own sake.</p>
