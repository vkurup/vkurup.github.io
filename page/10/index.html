          <p>I love watching Kavi&rsquo;s expressions. We took the kids to the <a href="http://www.ncmls.org/">Museum of Life and Science</a> for a birthday party today. He&rsquo;s been
there plenty of times, mostly with Mala. I&rsquo;ve been there a few times with
him. It&rsquo;s one of his (and I guess every kid&rsquo;s) favorite places. Each time
we go, it&rsquo;s a vastly different experience. Everything seems new to him. His
eyes light up with wonder and amazement at the exhibits.</p>
<p>We were late for the party, so Mala took Anika ahead of us while Kavi
dawdled in the front exhibits. Ahead of us was a large skeleton of a
dinosaur&rsquo;s head. I know that he has seen this before, but, it was as if
he&rsquo;d noticed it for the first time today. And it was scary. Not too scary,
mind you. He wasn&rsquo;t crying or anything. He just was very cautious about
getting too close to it. But, there was no way to avoid it, since the party
room (with the cake!) was just past the dinosaur. He held my hand tightly
and asked what it was. I told him and he repeated it, &ldquo;Dinosaur?&quot;. His eyes
were wide open, but focused on the T-Rex&rsquo;s head. His right hand clenched my
left and when I tried to walk past it, he pulled me back. Still no crying
or complaining, just &hellip; concern. So I took my time and talked to him about
the dinosaur and the other exhibits nearby. Eventually, he mustered up the
courage to walk around the back of the dinosaur and towards the party
room. Later, after the cake and festivities, we made our way back to the
other exhibits. This time, he pointed out the dinosaur, still in a
concerned voice, but made no effort to shy away or slow down. Now, he
noticed other things that he had missed before &ndash; cool astronauts uniforms
and a glass elevator slowly ascending. When he saw each of these things,
his face turned into the embodiment of wonder. Eyes wide open, jaw slightly
ajar. I love seeing him experience life like this, so fully.</p>
<p>I write this because I know that I&rsquo;m otherwise going to forget them. I had
the distinct feeling this afternoon, while watching him, that he was
growing up in front of my eyes. That these expressions of wonderment would
soon be replaced by the apathy of young adulthood. I know, I know&hellip; he&rsquo;s
only 2, but everyone keeps telling me that he will be grown and with kids
of his own before I know it! I hope not and if so, I hope not <em>too soon</em>. I
want to make sure that I remember these moments, simply for their own sake.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been a runner for a long time. I started running in junior high
school, so I could be on the track team. I&rsquo;ve had a few long stretches
where I didn&rsquo;t run, but for most of the past 25 years, I&rsquo;ve been a runner.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the 2005 New York Marathon though, that I really felt like
a runner. I had already run 2 marathons, but I had walked a lot in both of
them. I ran the entire NYC Marathon from beginning to end. That, to me, was
a <strong>huge</strong> deal. Before 2004, I don&rsquo;t think I would ever have believed that
I could do that. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that using walk breaks makes you
any less of a runner. But, <strong>for me</strong>, using walk breaks was a crutch. I&rsquo;d
gotten to the point that running 3, 4 or even 5 miles was easy. I dreaded
anything longer than that. If I was planning a 9 mile run, I would start
doing math in my head around mile 3. &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ve done 3 miles, now I just
need to do that again&hellip; and then again&hellip;&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s where I would defeat
myself. I mean, I was already tired at mile 3! How was I going to do that
same distance <em>twice</em> more?</p>
<p>Sometime around 2004, that changed. I was working at Metropolitan Hospital,
which is on 96th street and 1st avenue in NYC. I had decided to run the NYC
Marathon in 2005, but I wasn&rsquo;t training enough. After the subway ride home
from work, I would be drained, and going out for a run at 6 or 7 PM was
just too much to even think about. I&rsquo;m so glad that I had made the decision
to run the marathon. I hadn&rsquo;t even signed up - it was way too early - but
that decision in my brain was firm. I knew that I had to find a way to
train. Running in the morning was an option, but if you know me, then you
know that it wasn&rsquo;t. :-) Ironically, I&rsquo;m now up before 5AM every day these
days because of my 2 precious little ones. But, back in those bachelor
days, mornings didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I decided to make running part of my daily commute. I would take the subway
to work and then run home after work. I was living on 22nd St and 3rd
Avenue, so it was a 5 mile run along the East River. Living in NYC was so
convenient in that way. I never had to worry about leaving a car at work or
figuring out what to do if I couldn&rsquo;t run all the way home. The subway was
always there. I started out by running every couple days, then every other
day, and then, as many days as I could. It was great for training and for
my peace of mind. There&rsquo;s no better way to release the stress of a workday
than a long, easy run. I got much faster during the summer of 2004, and in
September, I ran the Staten Island Half Marathon in 1:41:56, which is much
faster than I ever dreamed was possible at that time.</p>
<p>But getting <em>faster</em> is not the point of this article. Running <em>longer</em> is.</p>
<p>The other thing that happened that summer was that I met and fell in love
with Mala. By the next spring, we had decided to move in together, and we
were both living in her tiny little apartment in the Bronx. At first, this
curbed my running a bit. But, eventually, I came to the same conclusions
that I had made the year before. I <strong>had</strong> to run and the only feasible way
was after work. But, the commute was now 8 miles instead of 5. And instead
of a leisurely jog along the East River, I now had a somewhat exhausting
urban trek through some shady neighborhoods. I never had any real problems,
but I always felt a little fear during parts of my run. Every once in a
while a teenager would see me running and shout something at me, or run
along with me for a few steps. But, it always seemed playful, so I never
felt too threatened. Running with a backpack through the South Bronx
probably made me the craziest thing in the neighborhood, so I didn&rsquo;t need
to worry :-) Anyway, the point is that my run was now longer and subway
stops were fewer and further between. In addition, I had all that fear, so
I felt that I needed to conserve energy in case, you know&hellip; I needed to
<strong>sprint!</strong></p>
<p>So, I ended up running a lot <strong>slower</strong>. Even though I was pretty sure I
could make it 8 miles, I started a lot slower and didn&rsquo;t start speeding up
until I was within a mile or two of home. And I don&rsquo;t mean just a little
slower. I would run so slow that I felt people were thinking, &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t
he just walk?&quot;. That was tough for me. As much as I hate to admit it, I do
think about what other people think, and the last thing I want anyone to
think is that I&rsquo;m a slow runner. But, I purposefully shed those superficial
inhibitions in the name of survival. I would slow WAY down. This eventually
served two purposes. The most important immediate purpose was that it
allowed to me to get home safely each night. The more lasting purpose was
that it gave me the confidence that I can always <em>build up energy</em> by
slowing down. No matter how tired I was, if I slowed down enough, I would
build up energy again. I know it makes sense, but I didn&rsquo;t believe it until
I tried it. And I guess I thought I <em>had</em> tried it before, but the problem
was my ego. I had never let myself really slow enough to the point that it
was valuable. Slowing down was the best thing I ever did as a runner.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s how I was able to run the NYC marathon without stopping in
2005. Now, even when I haven&rsquo;t been training regularly, I know that I can
run 10+ miles on any given day. Just by slowing down. They won&rsquo;t be the
fastest 10 miles I&rsquo;ve run, but it&rsquo;s such a great feeling to know that I can
do it. It gives me freedom in my runs, too. I know I can take any hill,
just by slowing down. I can speed up at any point in my run, just by
slowing down before and afterwards.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve gotten to the point that you can run 3 miles comfortably, but
couldn&rsquo;t dream of running 10 or 20, slow way down. So slow that you feel
like a fraud. See if that doesn&rsquo;t let you run longer. And if that fails,
try running in the Bronx :-)</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m too weak to lug around my monstrous 7 pound laptop, so I bought a
<a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/product1000.html">netbook</a>. It&rsquo;s an eeepc
1000 and I love it. I use it for everything, except for processing the
kids&rsquo; videos and photos. I still use the desktop for that.</p>
<p>The major issue that I&rsquo;ve had with it is that firefox seemed so slow. I
tried other browsers, some which seemed faster, but I missed my firefox
extensions. I googled and found that <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC/TipsAndTricks#SpeedupsluggishIceweasel.2BAC8-Firefox3">others had the same issue</a>. There
are 2 flash hard drives in the eeepc. The first is 8GB and contains the
root filesystem. The second is 32GB and contains the <code>/home</code>
partition. Apparently the 8GB drive is <strong>significantly</strong> faster than the
32GB one. So the OS performs excellently since it&rsquo;s on the 8GB drive,
anything that requires a lot of disk access from the 32GB drive slows
down. Firefox&rsquo;s <code>.mozilla</code> configuration folder is mounted there by
default.</p>
<p>Moving the <code>.mozilla</code> folder to the 8GB drive has made web browsing speedy
again. Here&rsquo;s how I did it. I&rsquo;m the only user on my system, so if you have
multiple users, this will only fix the issue for one user.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla
sudo chown vinod /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla
mv /home/vinod/.mozilla /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla/
ln -s /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla/.mozilla /home/vinod/.mozilla
</code></pre>

          <p>This site has undergone another transformation. I&rsquo;ve ditched <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and am now using a tool called <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. It&rsquo;s a program that runs on my laptop and generates static files from a bunch of templates. I then upload the static files to my server. Wordpress, like any dynamic software, has security risks. Especially since it&rsquo;s such a popular blog app, it&rsquo;s always under attack. I don&rsquo;t have the time or interest to keep up with updates, especially since my blogging is so low-profile. It&rsquo;s just something I do for fun.</p>
<p>Static files have none of those security risks. There are a lot of static file generators out there, but I chose Jekyll because it seemed intuitive and it&rsquo;s run by the <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> folks. I&rsquo;ve started using git and GitHub and am impressed by their power so far.</p>
<p>This takes me full circle to my post-geocities days when I was generating static pages using <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Userland Frontier</a>. This still doesn&rsquo;t feel as satisfying as that did, but maybe that&rsquo;s only because it was such a new thing back then. I must admit that writing posts in emacs sure does feel nice.</p>
<p>Anyway, the design is completely ripped off from <a href="http://mark.reid.name">Mark Reid</a>. My design skills suck, and his rock. Of course, I am a tweaker, so I&rsquo;ll probably end up ruining his beauty at some point.</p>

          <p><em>I&rsquo;ve found some old journal entries lying around my hard drive. I&rsquo;m sure that these were meant to be cleaned up and edited before being spewed on the Internet, but in keeping with my newfound obsession with <a href="/blog/2009/02/04/imperfection">Imperfection</a>, I now present them to you, my dear reader(s). Here is the first one, a review of the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vinodkurupshomep&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060920432">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></p>
<p><strong>Bronx, NY, April 9th, 2007</strong></p>
<p>I finished &ldquo;Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience&rdquo; by Mihaly Csikszenthmihalyi on the subway ride into work today. I enjoyed the book. It&rsquo;s about creating optimal experience in your life. &ldquo;Optimal Experience&rdquo; is the feeling you get when you&rsquo;re doing something challenging and interesting and time just flows by you without you realizing it.</p>
<p>Our quality of life is directly related to how often we obtain &ldquo;optimal experience&rdquo;. Things that we normally associate with a high quality of life are not necessarily correlated with subjective happiness. Got money, power, and health? You&rsquo;re just as likely to be unhappy than if you don&rsquo;t have them. So, how can we achieve optimal experience? It&rsquo;s about being in control of your consiciousness. Deciding what things give you challenge, what things interest you &hellip; and then pursue them.</p>
<p>Our natural tendency is to think that we want more leisure time and that more leisure time will make us happier. He debunks this by showing that people are just as happy when they are at work as when at leisure. Often happier. Most lesiure activities simply allow us to veg out instead of encouraging us to actively use our consciousness. They are a way to avoid letting our consciousness focus on the stressors in our life. If we were to let our mind go, without providing it any outside stimulus, the first thing we would focus on is our anxieties. Things that we are worried about. The solution is to <strong>actively</strong> force our consciousness to think about other things, perhaps solutions to those anxieties, or other things that would make us happy. That&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s easier to turn on the TV and let the stimuli flow in, so that our mind is occupied and can&rsquo;t wander off to those dark anxieties. But that only stunts our growth. Learning to be able to face our anxieties and know that we can overcome them (through repeat example) is the way towards a more happy existence.</p>
<p>How does this book affect me? It was written in 1990 and I&rsquo;ve seen it referred to often. It makes me want to focus more on meditation and yoga. This is the second book that I&rsquo;ve read recently that recommended control of consciousness as an important objective. The other one was <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2274">How to live on 24 hours a day</a>, written at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>I want to structure activites so as to give myself some challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly</strong>, I want to be able to give my children the easiest path to optimal experience possible. This means giving them unconditional love, constant challenges and the ability to <strong>make and learn from mistakes</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are a few pertinent excerpts from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p2. &ldquo;People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to happy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p6. &ldquo;The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy &ndash; or attention &ndash; is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Elements of Enjoyment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Challenging activity that requires skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The merging of action and awareness</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When all a person&rsquo;s relevant skills are needed to cope with the
challenges of a situation, that person&rsquo;s attentions is completely
absorbed by the activity. There is no excess psychic energy left over
to process any information but what the activity offers. All the
attention is concentrated on the relevant stimuli. As a result, one of
the most universal and distinctive features of optimal experience
takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing that
they activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being
aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.&rdquo;
(p. 53)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>clear goals and feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>concentration on the task at hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sense of exercising control in difficult situations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loss of self consciousness</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>p83. &ldquo;For example, TV watching, the single most often pursued leisure activity in the United States today, leads to the flow condition very rarely. In fact, working people achieve the flow experience &ndash; deep concentration, high and balanced challenges and skills, a sense of control and satisfaction &ndash; about four times as often on their jobs, proportionately, as they do when they are watching television.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Promoting optimal experience in teenagers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clarity - teens know what their parents expect of them</li>
<li>Centering - teens perceive that their parents are interested in what they are doing in the present, rather than being preoccupied about the future</li>
<li>Choice - teens feel they have a variety of choices, including breaking parental rules as long as they are willing to deal with consequences</li>
<li>Commitment - teens feel comfortable enough to set aside defenses and become unselfconsciously involved in whatever they are interested in</li>

<blockquote>
<p>p119. &ldquo;Without training, and without an object in the external world that demands attention, people are unable to focus their thoughts for more than a few minutes at a time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t usually notice how little control we have over the mind, because habits channel psychic energy so well that thoughts seem to follow each other by themselves without a hitch. After sleeping we regain consciousness in the morning when the alarm rings, and then walk to the bathroom and brush our teeth. The social roles culture prescribes then take care of shaping our minds for us, and we generally place ourselves on automatic pilot till the end of the day, when it is time again to lose consciousness in sleep. But when we are left alone, with no demands on attention, the basic disorder of the mind reveals itself. With nothing to do, it begins to follow random patterns, usually stopping to consider something painful or disturbing. Unless a person knows how to give order to his or her thoughts, attention will be attracted to whatever is most problematic at the moment: it will focus on some real or imaginary pain, on recent grudges or long-term frustrations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p133. &ldquo;Having a record of the past can make a great contribution to the quality of life. It frees us from the tyranny of the present, and makes it possible for consciousness to revisit former times.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p139. &ldquo;In philosophy as in other disciplines there comes a point where a person is ready to pass from the status of passive consumer to that of active producer. &hellip; But if one records ideas in response to an inner challenge to express clearly the major questions by which one feels confronted, and tried to sketch out answers that will help make sense of one&rsquo;s experiences, then the amateur philosopher will have learned to derive enjoyment from one of the most difficult and rewarding tasks of life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p179. &ldquo;In other words, accepting limitations is liberating. For example, by making up one&rsquo;s mind to invest psychic energy exlussively in a monogamous marriage, regardless of any problems, obstacles, or more attractive options that may come along later, one is freed of the constant pressure of trying to maximize emotional returns.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p180. &ldquo;For such goals to result in interactions that will help increase the complexity of its members, the family must be both differentiated and integrated. Differentiation means that each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits, maximize personal skills, set individual goals. Integration, in contrast, guarantees that what happens to one person will affect all others. If a child is proud of what she accomplished in school, the rest of the family will pay attention and will be proud of her, too. If the mother is tired and depressed, the family will try to help and cheer her up. In an integrated family, each person&rsquo;s goals matter to all others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to get Optimal Experience?</p>
<ol>
<li>set goals</li>
<li>become immersed in the activity</li>
<li>pay attention to what is happening</li>
<li>learning to enjoy immediate experience</li>

          <p><a href="http://kottke.org/09/05/99-classical-mp3s-for-8">Kottke</a> linked to some great deals on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U1J2S4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vinodkurupshomep&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001U1J2S4">classical music at amazon</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In order to download them, you need to have the amazon mp3 downloader installed. They now offer a Debian (linux) version, but I couldn&rsquo;t get it working. It&rsquo;s meant for an older version of Debian, but it doesn&rsquo;t recognize the newer versions of the libraries installed on my system. I thought about doing some fancy apt-getting to try to get the right versions, but just thinking about that made my head throb. Then I heard about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/clamz/">clamz</a>, an open source project to replicate the amazon mp3 downloader. I installed the library packages they recommended (libgcrypt11-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev, and libexpat1-dev) and then installed it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always a little leary to install packages from source, because then they&rsquo;re not managed by the package manager (apt-get). It becomes more of a tedious process to keep them updated or to uninstall them. To partially workaround that problem, I use a program called <a href="http://www.asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/">checkinstall</a>. It basically creates a package for any program that you want to install from source. So, instead of :</p>
<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>you do:</p>
<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo checkinstall
</code></pre>
<p>It then creates a .deb and installs it. It asks you for some basic info about the program, but guesses as much as it can and does a decent job. I haven&rsquo;t delved into anything more involved than that, but there are ways to document dependencies which would allow it to be even more integrated into the package management system.</p>
<p>Anyway, it installed perfectly and within seconds I was downloading the music that I had purchased.</p>

          <p>In order to lose any remaining readers, I am very proud to announce that Kavi made a poopy in his potty. First time! It may well have been a lucky accident, but I&rsquo;m happy about it. In other news, Anika is 1 week old and doing great.</p>

          <p>Kavi, Mala and I are so happy to announce the arrival of Anika Puri Kurup. She was born on June 22nd, 2009 at 11:07 PM after a happily uneventful labor and delivery. Mom and Baby are doing well. Here is a quick video, with of course more to follow soon.</p>

          <p>I can barely believe it, but Kavi is 2 years old now. This is such a great age. I remember saying that a year ago, but he&rsquo;s even more enjoyable now. He&rsquo;s excited about everything new. He&rsquo;s running nonstop, singing out loud, and dancing up a storm.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/vvkurup/KaviBirthday">Mala organized a great birthday party</a> for him at a local park. He got a lot of great gifts from all his friends, some of which we&rsquo;re saving so that he can open when the new baby is getting a lot of attention. But, his Mossa and Mossi got him the best gift of all by delivering Vishali into this world the day before his birthday. Kavi has been enamored with her from day 1. She&rsquo;s now a week old, and Kavi will still drop whatever he&rsquo;s doing (even if it&rsquo;s drinking milk or playing in his black truck) to come over and &lsquo;kiss baby shali&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re just waiting for our bundle of joy :-)</p>
