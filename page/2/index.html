  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I set up an OBi110 device to provide a landline at home. OK, it&rsquo;s not a land line, it&rsquo;s
a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) line, but it performs a similar function. We&rsquo;ve
always had a landline. Our cell phone coverage is spotty at times and ever since Mala
started working from home, she needs to have a reliable phone line for her global
conference calls.</p>
<p>The problem is that Spectrum was charging us $44.95 per month plus taxes, which took it
near $50 every month. I considered a few options including:</p>
<ul>
<li>MagicJack</li>
<li>Ooma</li>
<li>I looked at a few others&hellip; can&rsquo;t remember them all</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I settled on buying an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_telephone_adapter">ATA device</a> and then connecting it
to a cheaper VOIP service. I chose <a href="https://voip.ms">voip.ms</a> which has been great so
far.</p>
<p>One Time Costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2EivFuP">OBi110</a> ATA device: $19.90</li>
<li>voip.ms setup fee: $0.40</li>
<li>voip.ms e911 setup fee: $1.50</li>
</ul>
<p>Monthly Costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>voip.ms fee for an incoming phone number: $0.85</li>
<li>voip.ms e911 monthly fee: $1.50</li>
</ul>
<p>Per-Minute Costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>voip.ms incoming: $0.009 per minute</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on my monthly per-minute costs because there is an unlimited
plan that is $4.25 per month, which I&rsquo;ll switch to if I use more than that per month. In
any case, this is MUCH cheaper than Spectrum.</p>
<p>Now, if you do any research about the OBi110 device, you&rsquo;ll see everyone telling you not
to buy it because it is out of service and doesn&rsquo;t support Google Voice. This is true,
ObiTalk doesn&rsquo;t support the device anymore. When it was supported by the company, you
could just dial a special code on your phone and it would do all the set up for you.
Since it&rsquo;s not supported, that procedure doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. But you can <a href="https://wiki.voip.ms/article/OBi_100/110_%26_OBi_200">manually configure the device</a> with the
excellent docs from voip.ms, and for a geek like me that was not bad. And yes, you can&rsquo;t
link a Google Voice number to the device, but I didn&rsquo;t want to do that anyway. I think
if you wanted to keep using a google voice number, you could probably get pretty close
by putting a different number on your device (through voip.ms) and then pointing Google
Voice at that number. Incoming calls would work fine in that way, but I&rsquo;m not sure about
outgoing calls. If you want to seamlessly use Google Voice on an ATA device, then OBi110
isn&rsquo;t for you. You&rsquo;ll need the OBI202 (which was out of stock when I was looking).</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I worked on adding tests to some Django forms today and I was reminded that Django forms
operate in two <em>modes</em>. I think of them as the GET mode and the POST mode. The GET mode
displays the form and the POST mode processes the data that you supply to the form. I
don&rsquo;t know why, but I often forget that. Instead, I sometimes treat them as a normal
Python class, especially when I&rsquo;m creating automated tests for them. I instantiate
the class (<code>form = MyForm()</code>) and then just call any of its methods and make sure they
return the right values or achieve the correct side effects. The form that I was working
with today had a couple features. The first was that it provided some helper functions
to the template so that the template could display the form properly. Those are in the
GET mode. So I did something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>user = create_my_special_user()
form = MyForm(user=user)
self.assertTrue(form.is_user_special())
</code></pre><p>And that worked as I expected. The second feature of my custom form was that it cleaned
the data in a particular way. So I did:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>form = MyForm(user=user)
cleaned_data = form.clean()
self.assertEqual(cleaned_data, expected_data)
</code></pre><p>Instead of passing, the test blew up:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>AttributeError: 'MyForm' object has no attribute 'cleaned_data'
</code></pre><p>Why? Because the <code>clean()</code> method is called when you provide it with POST data
(normally&hellip; there are also other ways to populate forms). If you don&rsquo;t supply it data,
then <code>cleaned_data</code> doesn&rsquo;t get populated. The answer is to provide data to the form:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>form = MyForm(user=user, data={})
cleaned_data = form.clean()
self.assertEqual(cleaned_data, expected_data)
</code></pre><p>And that works as expected. The reminder to myself is to always identify which mode of
the form you are testing, GET or POST.</p>

          <p>These are very rough notes on how I got AWS Xray working in a kubernetes deployment.
Posting this mainly for my auxiliary brain.</p>
<p>First, set up an IAM role that allows nodes to access xray.</p>
<p>Following this blog post:
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/application-tracing-on-kubernetes-with-aws-x-ray/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/application-tracing-on-kubernetes-with-aws-x-ray/</a></p>
<p>I cloned this repo:
<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-xray-kubernetes">https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-xray-kubernetes</a></p>
<p>Build the AWS Xray image:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd xray-daemon/
docker build -t xray-daemon:latest .
</code></pre><p>THIS OUT OF DATE! try this: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon-ecs.html#xray-daemon-ecs-image">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon-ecs.html#xray-daemon-ecs-image</a></p>
<p>Create an AWS ECR repo:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws ecr create-repository --repository-name xray-daemon
</code></pre><p>Login via docker:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws ecr get-login --no-include-email
</code></pre><p>That command spits out a command which you can run that will log you into docker ^</p>
<p>Tag and push the image there:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>docker tag xray-daemon:latest AWS-ACCOUNT-ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/xray-daemon:latest
docker push AWS-ACCOUNT-ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/xray-daemon:latest
</code></pre><p>You should now be able to see the image in the AWS ECR console</p>
<p>Update <code>aws-xray-kubernetes/xray-daemon/xray-k8s-daemonset.yaml</code>:</p>
<p>Change the image value to the image you just pushed</p>
<p>deploy it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>kubectl apply -f xray-k8s-daemonset.yaml
</code></pre>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>At school, Kavi is reading
<a href="https://amzn.to/2PctnQm">&ldquo;We have always lived in the castle&rdquo;</a>, by Shirley Jackson. I
read her short story,
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/06/26/the-lottery">&ldquo;The Lottery&rdquo;</a>, in high school. I
recall the main plot of the story, but I&rsquo;m sure I have forgotten many details.
What I <strong>haven&rsquo;t</strong> forgotten is the sense of shock I felt as the plot finally became
clear. As I&rsquo;m typing this, I wonder if that was more because I was young and new to
being shocked, or whether it was really shocking. In any case, that feeling of being
shocked by that story is deeply embedded inside me.</p>
<p>So I checked this book from the library and finished it today. It was dark and
disturbing, reminiscent of &ldquo;The Lottery&rdquo;. There were many elements of foreshadowing.
From the start, you wonder what Mary Katherine or her family did to sow such discontent
among the villagers, and the answer comes slowly, in bits and pieces. I wondered why
they had library books that they would never be able to return. In the end, I was sucked
in and couldn&rsquo;t put the book down until I figured it all out. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s a short
book.</p>
<p>Some random thoughts that my brain generated while reading this book (and that I&rsquo;d
prefer to remember someday):</p>
<ul>
<li>When Merrikat and Connie first enter their house after it was trashed by the village,
Merrikat is not surprised that the library books are intact because it&rsquo;s against the law
to damage library property. I smiled.</li>
<li>The absurdity of Merrikat&rsquo;s behavior at times struck me hard. The first time was when
she threw a glass pitcher on the floor because she was upset by a visitor talking to her
sister too much. I had to re-read that section a few times because it was written in an
almost off-hand way, as if this was normal behavior. She continues to behave like that
in bursts, and then the more absurd part becomes Connie&rsquo;s calm reaction to these
behaviors. Piece by piece, you get to understand more about how disturbed they are, and
why.</li>
<li>Merrikat&rsquo;s belief in magical powers that keep her safe are both hard to believe and
comforting. I kept waiting for someone to say one of her three magic words, as if that
was the only way that anything could go wrong.</li>
<li>I wanted Charles to be taught a lesson. I guess it happened, but a part of me wanted
it to be more dramatic and more crushing. I&rsquo;m a sucker for an evil character doing
clearly evil things and then getting caught red-handed and punished. I know that&rsquo;s
simplistic, but I still like it and am a little disappointed when I don&rsquo;t get that
satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love the fact that I&rsquo;m finding books to enjoy, thanks to my kids. Life is good.</p>

          <p>I just finished <a href="https://amzn.to/35FoTXV">Open Borders</a>, a graphic novel about immigration policy.
(Not 2 things that normally occupy the same sentence)</p>
<p>It was an excellent presentation of a position that I&rsquo;ve always felt to be morally correct, in my
heart of hearts. I am one of the few lucky ones who gets to be an American citizen just because of
the fact that my parents took it on themselves to forge a better life for us. Why shouldn&rsquo;t everyone
have this opportunity? This book shatters many of the myths that allowing open borders makes things
&ldquo;worse&rdquo; in any way for natives.</p>

          <p>Whenever I come across a book that I want to read, I add it to my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3158304-vinod-kurup">Goodreads</a> to-read list. This list,
of course, is always growing. I&rsquo;m very slowly coming to terms with the fact that I will never make
it through this list and that someday I will die, with unread books on my to-read list. Horrors! The
other major problem with this simple approach to a reading list is that I can never remember why I
added a book to my list. If it was a recent addition, I might recall, but in most cases I just can&rsquo;t
remember why I wanted to read the book in the first place.</p>
<p>In that way, the book Deep Survival made it to my to-read list last year, and I picked it up for my
Kindle when it went on sale recently:</p>

  <img class="caption" src="/images/deep-forget.png" title="Knocking off a to-read" alt="Knocking off a to-read">
  <span class="caption-text">Knocking off a to-read</span>
</span>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten through the first few chapters so far. I have been enjoying it, but something about it
is bothering me. It felt very <em>familiar</em>. Maybe that is what happened&hellip; I read a teaser for the book in
a magazine article or something, and that is why I added it to my to-read list last year.</p>
<p>And then yesterday, while I was converting the blog from Octopress to Hugo, I had to fix up some
posts, so I ended up looking through a bunch of my old posts, including&hellip;. <a href="/blog/2007/04/15/deep-survival/">my book review of Deep Survival</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird feeling to read a review about a book that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to read for over a year,
written by a 12 year younger version of yourself.</p>

          <p>Kavi was looking over my shoulder as I tried to get my blog working in a local Docker container.
I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point that the site seems to be up and running in the container, but I can&rsquo;t seem
to get to it from my laptop. So, he wondered why I was putting port 1313 in my URL bar
(&ldquo;localhost:1313&rdquo;) and then I showed the results of <code>netstat -ant</code> to prove that something should be
listening on that port. And we got the IP address for google.com and then put that in Chrome&rsquo;s URL
bar with <code>:80</code> at the end of it, and magically, it worked. (Other websites did not work, and I
explained that most sites will not allow their sites to be accessed via IP address).</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t figured out why I can&rsquo;t access the blog running in my container, but I think Kavi&rsquo;s
learning more about networking than I ever did (and I&rsquo;m hoping that he&rsquo;ll be able to debug these
issues for me&hellip; soon enough)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>UPDATE: I figured it out. Hugo&rsquo;s server was listening on localhost inside the container, when it
needed to be listening on 0.0.0.0. Adding that as a <code>--bind</code> parameter fixed the issue (though I had
to also add <code>--baseURL</code> and <code>--appendPort=false</code> params, which saddened me.)</p>

          <p>I moved my blog from Octopress to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> today. I had been <a href="https://kurup.org/blog/2014/07/22/pygments-on-arch-linux/">slightly unhappy with Octopress for a while now</a>, but
mainly I just wanted something new to play with. Hugo is MUCH faster than Octopress was:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>It is nice to generate my entire site in less than a second.</p>
<p>But I still liked the style and theme of my old site, so I was happy to find that <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-octopress/">someone had already built an Octopress theme for Hugo</a>. I promptly
stole his work and customized a few things here and there to make it look (nearly) exactly like my
old site did. Yay! Thanks to <a href="https://parsiya.net/">Parsia</a> for building that theme. I&rsquo;ve also
subscribed to his RSS feed because his site looks pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Moving my content wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it wasn&rsquo;t hard. I mainly just copied the old markdown posts over,
changed the front matter, and then fixed a few octopress plugins I was using to work with Hugo.</p>
<p>Future steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch from Disqus to something self-hosted</li>
<li>Generate the HTML on the server rather than having the HTML in git</li>
<li>Update my About page and Computers page</li>
<li>&hellip; oh, maybe write more!</li>
</ul>

          <p>&ldquo;Here it comes!&rdquo; His eyes light up.<br>
Slurps one last sip from his small cup.</p>
<p>Then bounding from the kitchen table,<br>
Fast as lighting, he is able</p>
<p>To trash his scraps and stow his dishes.<br>
He yells to Mom, &ldquo;It was delicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more breath then on the couch he lands.<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; says Mom. Dad shrugs his hands.</p>
<p>Big brother also has no idea.<br>
Big sister sighs, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a weird one I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We gather round to be sure he&rsquo;s fine.<br>
Eyes glued to his wrist, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 7:29!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the beeping fills the room.<br>
The smile confirms he&rsquo;s over the moon.</p>
<p>The source of this happiness, on his arm,<br>
His brand new watch, and a 7:30 alarm.</p>
<p>(A real-life story, barely embellished)</p>
