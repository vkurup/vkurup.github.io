          <p>Loyal readers of my blog will remember that my Powerbook Wallstreet G3 died on September 21st, 2002. Since I&rsquo;m probably the only one that remembers, I&rsquo;ll point you to that <a href="http://kurup.org/blog/2002/09/22/rip">blog entry</a>. The good news was that the hard drive was intact, the bad news was that I didn&rsquo;t have an easy way of accessing it. I have a Firewire enclosure, and my old Powerbook was running Linux, so I figured it wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to get my new Powerbook to read the data off the old HD. I mean Mac OS X and Linux are the same underneath, right? Well, not quite. Mac OS X uses a filesystem called HFS+ and my version of Linux uses a filesystem called ext2. Turns out that no one had written an ext2 driver for Mac OS X.</p>
<p>So, I turned to Google and with more effort than usual, found the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsx/">Mac OS X Ext2 Filesystem</a> Project, or ext2fsx. I subscribed to the RSS feed and just waited until I saw the 1.0.1 product released on 11/20/2003 (Never trust the 1.0!). I loaded it up and voila! My old Wallstreet was back. Thank you <a href="http://www.classicalguitar.net/brian/">Brian Bergstrand</a>!</p>
<p>In celebration, I&rsquo;ve uploaded <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/index?folder_id=9672">pictures from 2001 and early 2002</a> that I thought I had lost forever. Enjoy.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p><a href="http://badgertronics.com">Badgertronics.com</a>, <a href="http://borkware.com">borkware.com</a>, and company went through the same ordeal that <a href="http://kurup.org/blog/2003/12/17/im-back">kurup.org</a> did and MarkD has promptly published his <a href="http://borkware.com/rants/rsync-backups/">new backup strategy</a>. He uses <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> over <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">SSH</a> which, interestingly enough, is the same strategy that I came up with. Great minds must think alike.</p>
<p>The canonical standard for doing backups on UNIX systems is tar (short for <strong>t</strong>ape <strong>ar</strong>chive). tar converts directories of files into a single tar archive file which you would then spit to an attached tape drive. To be up-to-date, you need to do this on a regular basis - perhaps daily. So each day, you&rsquo;d tar up all your important files and send them off to the tape drive. To recover your files, you&rsquo;d need to read the whole tar archive file back from the tape and then extract the specific files or directories that you want from the tar archive. This works fine if you&rsquo;re backing up to a tape drive, because you don&rsquo;t care about network bandwidth. If you&rsquo;re backing up over the network to another machine&rsquo;s hard drive, then each daily archive file has to be sent over the network to your backup machine. Even if you don&rsquo;t change any files from one day to the next, the entire set of files gets archived and sent across the network. Bye bye precious bandwidth!</p>
<p>rsync is a <strong>r</strong>emote <strong>sync</strong>hronization tool. The first time, rsync sends all the data over the network to your backup machine. Just like tar. The benefit comes the next time you backup. Instead of sending all the files again, rsync only transfers files that have been changed. If no files were changed, no files get transferred. And when you want to recover data, you transfer just the specific files that you want back to your machine (using rsync or scp or telnet or whatever).</p>
<p>Note that rsync also works better than an incremental backup strategy using tar. You can use tar to do a full backup weekly and incremental backups daily. Incremental backups backup just files which have changed since yesterday&rsquo;s backup. This will improve bandwidth usage, but makes recovery more complex. You have to extract the latest full backup, then extract any more recent incremental backups over your full backup and then extract the specific files that you need. On the other hand, the backup produced with rsync is always up-to-date (as of the last time you ran rsync).</p>
<p>There are lots of backup tools that use rsync as their workhorse and add features on top of it. <a href="http://rdiff-backup.stanford.edu/">rdiff-backup</a> makes regularly scheduled backups, but each time it runs, it keeps a copy of the changes to any files which have changed (i.e. the diff&rsquo;s) as well as the date and time of those changes. So, while the backup filesystem is a perfect mirror of your system, a few extra commands can give you a copy of your filesystem as it was, say, 5 days ago. rdiff-backup takes the backup filesystem and applies any diffs that occurred over the past five days. Diff files only record changes from one version of a file to another, so they are very small (in proportion to the entire backup). This allows rdiff-backup to provide snapshots of your system at almost any time without using a significant amount of disk space.</p>
<p>I tried rdiff-backup and it works great for Linux to Linux backups, but it gave me trouble when I tried to backup Linux to Mac OS X. Linux uses a case-sensitive filesystem (ext2). You can have the files <code>foo</code> and <code>FOO</code> in the same directory and Linux treats them as different files. Mac OS X&rsquo;s file system is case-insensitive, so if you make a file <code>FOO</code>, it will overwrite a file <code>foo</code> in the same directory. rdiff-backup tries to take this into account by quoting any filename with capital letters in it. Unfortunately, the most recent version from CVS (as of 2004-01-01) <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/rdiff-backup-users/2003-12/msg00045.html">doesn&rsquo;t properly unquote them</a>. Even if it did work properly, it ruins one of the main benefits of using rsync - having a true mirror of your system. Now instead of having a file <code>README</code> in your backup, you have a file <code>;082;069;065;068;077;069</code> (that&rsquo;s <code>README</code> quoted). I can no longer just scp a directory from my Mac backup machine to my linux server. I have to use rdiff-backup to do the transfer so that it gets properly unquoted. I would prefer to be able to turn the quoting stuff off completely. If you&rsquo;re crazy enough to have 2 files in a Linux directory with the same name, but just capitalized differently, you&rsquo;re just asking for trouble.</p>
<p>I also realized that rdiff-backup is overkill for what I need. If I really want to be able to recover a file that I deleted 5 days ago, I should be using CVS for that data. My backups are there simply for unexpected data loss.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m currently using plain rsync over SSH. I do 2 things to prepare my system before running rsync. First, I run <code>dpkg --get-selections</code> to dump a list of my installed Debian packages. When recovering my system, I can feed that file to <code>dpkg --set-selections</code> and then run <code>apt-get dselect-upgrade</code> to get all my packages set up as I had before. So, I put this in my crontab:</p>
<pre><code> # save apt selections 00 20 * * *  /usr/bin/dpkg --get-selections &gt; /home/vinod/apt-settings/dpkg-selections
</code></pre>
<p>The other thing I need to do is to dump my Postgres databasse. I currently do this from a scheduled procedure in AOLserver as documented at the bottom of the <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4-6-3/backup-recovery.html">OpenACS 4.6.3 documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to rsync. Like MarkD, I&rsquo;m going to run rsync from my Mac and pull the data from the Linux server over to the Mac. Unlike MarkD, I&rsquo;m going to run rsync as my root user so that I can preserve users and groups of my <code>/etc</code> files. Here&rsquo;s my root crontab entry on my Mac (split into multiple lines for reading convenience):</p>
<pre><code>00 21 * * * rsync -av --numeric-ids --delete --delete-excluded
   --exclude-from=/Users/vinod/backup/acorn_exclude -e ssh acorn:/
   /Users/vinod/backup/acorn/latest &gt;&gt; /Users/vinod/backup/backup.log
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'v'</code> option is for verbose, which I&rsquo;ll turn off eventually once I know things are working well. The <code>--numeric-ids</code> option preserves the user and group ids as numeric ids rather than trying to use user/group names from my Mac. the <code>--delete</code> and <code>--delete-excluded</code> make sure that files deleted on the Linux server are also deleted in the backup. The <code>--exclude-from</code> reads <code>/Users/vinod/backup/acorn_exclude</code> and follows its instructions as to which files to backup. I&rsquo;ll talk about that next. The <code>-e</code> option says to use SSH to transfer the data. Finally the last two options say to get the data from host acorn (set to vkurup.acornhosting.net in <code>/etc/hosts</code>) and rsync it to <code>/Users/vinod/backup/acorn/latest</code>. To see exactly what files rsync is excluding or including, add another <code>-v</code> option to rsync. Also useful is the <code>-n</code> option, which tells rsync to show you what it would do without actually transferring anything.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what my exclude file looks like:</p>
<pre><code>- *~
+ /etc 
- /home/vinod/web/kurup/log 
+ /home 
+ /root 
+ /usr 
+ /usr/local 
- /usr/* 
- /var/lib/courier 
- /var/lib/postgres/data 
+ /var 
+ /var/lib 
- /var/* 
- /*
</code></pre>
<p>The rsync exclude syntax allows you to backup just the files you want. I&rsquo;ll just discuss a couple examples, so you should see the manpage for more details. Line 1 says to ignore any emacs backup files. Line 3 says to ignore <code>/home/vinod/web/kurup/log</code> while Line 4 says to include everything else in the <code>/home</code> directory. Conversely, line 7 says to include <code>/usr/local</code> (and everything in it), while Line 8 says to ignore anything else in the <code>/usr</code> directory. Line 6 is important. If you didn&rsquo;t include it, nothing in <code>/usr/local</code> would get included. Each filename is checked against this list, but in a recursive fashion. So if rsync is working on the file <code>/usr/local/foo</code>, it first looks for a pattern that matches <code>/usr</code>, then for a pattern that matches <code>/usr/local</code>, then finally for a pattern that matches <code>/usr/local/foo</code>. It uses the first pattern that matches. So, if you didn&rsquo;t include line 6, the search for <code>/usr</code> would find line 8 and stop, thus excluding everything in <code>/usr/local</code>. Not what you want. I know that was confusing - recursion always makes my head spin&hellip;</p>
<p>OK, the final thing is to set up SSH properly. I basically set it up like MarkD did, but since I need to login as root, I wanted to add a few more constraints. You can set up SSH to restrict a specific key to only run a certain command. So if someone somehow gets access to my key, they&rsquo;ll only be able to run rsync. If you don&rsquo;t put the command restriction in, they&rsquo;ll be able to login to your server as root. To add restraints to a key, add some statements to the beginning of the key in authorized_keys2. Here&rsquo;s my <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys2</code> (split onto multiple lines):</p>
<pre><code>command=&quot;rsync --server --sender -vlogDtpr --delete-excluded --numeric-ids . /&quot;  
ssh-rsa AAAAB....&lt;snip&gt; ...t8= root@Vinod-Kurups-Computer.local. 
</code></pre>
<p>To get the proper command to put in your command=&quot;&quot; statement, run your rsync command with an unrestricted SSH key first (i.e. just copy the id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys2). When you run the rsync command on your Mac, do a <code>ps auxw | grep rsync</code> on the server machine. The command that you see listed is the command that goes in the key.</p>
<p>After reading MarkD&rsquo;s article, the one thing I might change is to tar up the data on the Linux server that needs its user/group info preserved (<code>/etc</code>, <code>/root</code>, and <code>/usr/local</code>) and then store that on the server in my user&rsquo;s home directory. I then wouldn&rsquo;t have to rsync as root, so it would simplify things. The drawback is that anytime anything changed in any of those directories, I&rsquo;d be backing up the entire directories again. Hopefully this would be mitigated by the fact that they wouldn&rsquo;t change often and since they&rsquo;re mostly text files, they compress well.</p>

          <p>This site was down for the past few days due to a <a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=152527">SNAFU with acornhosting&rsquo;s upstream provider</a>. You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d have learned to have a backup strategy in place by now, but you&rsquo;d be overestimating my intelligence. Luckily, Cathy was somehow able to negotiate with her failed upstream provider to get my (and other acornhosting customers') data back. After this episode, I promise to backup religiously and I&rsquo;m even more sold on <a href="http://acornhosting.net">acornhosting</a> as a solid web hosting provider.</p>

          <p>I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471827223/vinodkurupshomep">Quick Calculus: A Self-Teaching Guide, 2nd Edition</a> by Daniel Kleppner and Norman Ramsey. I found a few errors, but couldn&rsquo;t find an errata listing online, so I&rsquo;m documenting them here for future reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Page 107, Frame 206. The quotient rule as it&rsquo;s initially expressed is incorrect. The correct version is stated at the bottom of the page and also on page 102, Frame 194.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 173, Frame 330. None of the options listed are correct. The correct answer is 15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 187, Frame 355. The initial expression of Simpson&rsquo;s rule is confusing. It should be: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ∫<!-- raw HTML omitted -->A<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->B<!-- raw HTML omitted --> y dx = 2/6 Δ (y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->0<!-- raw HTML omitted --> + 4y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> + y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> + <!-- raw HTML omitted -->y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> +<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 4y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> + y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> + &hellip; + y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->N-2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> + 4y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->N-1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> + y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->N<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Errors in technical books annoy me because I spend way too much time trying to figure out why I&rsquo;m mixed up. Not having a published errata online annoys me even more. See <a href="http://borkware.com/corebook/errata">Mark&rsquo;s book</a> for an errata page done right.</p>
<p>All ranting aside, Quick Calculus is an ideal resource if you&rsquo;re looking to brush up on the basics of Calculus. It&rsquo;s short and interactive, yet it doesn&rsquo;t sugarcoat the material.</p>

          <p>Researchers at my alma mater have shown that <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/9208.html">mice who have been bred to run long distances show increased activity in &lsquo;craving&rsquo; regions of the brain when they&rsquo;re denied access to their running wheel</a> (Be sure to check out the Quicktime video on that page). The addiction of running is physiologically similar to other addictions. Maybe that explains why I was out on the East River Path in 29 degree weather tonight.</p>

          <p>I ran two more races this past week - the <a href="http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a31123&amp;result.year=2003">Race to Deliver 4 mile</a> in Central Park on Sunday and the <a href="http://pptc.org/gallery/2003_pptc_turkey_trot/2003_turkey_trot_gallery_01.php">Turkey Trot 5 mile</a> in <a href="http://www.prospectpark.org/index.cfm">Prospect Park</a> yesterday. The Race to Deliver was crowded with 6000 or so other runners and I spent most of the first half of the race just swerving around everyone else. I never quite got into a groove, but I was still able to finish in 32:34.</p>
<p>The Turkey Trot was much more fun. The first half mile was crowded, but the rest of the race was smooth sailing. I&rsquo;d never been to Prospect Park before and I was pleasantly surprised by its beauty. New York City is certainly blessed with great public parks. Anyway, I ran the last 2 miles in 15 minutes to finish in 40:12. I hope to break the 8 minute barrier soon&hellip;</p>

          <p>I ran the <a href="http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a31116&amp;result.year=2003">NYRR Cross Country Championships</a> this AM in 26:48 for 5K. My last cross country race was 15 years ago as a senior in high school. Wow, writing that sentence makes me feel old :-) In those days, I could run 5K in 19 minutes easily and I thought that 7 minute miles were slow. Ahh, to be young again! The NYRR run is held at Van Cortland Park, a beautiful oasis in the Bronx and the race starts out deceptively flat. You run along the edge of the some soccer fields for the first mile and then enter into a forest where nothing but steep unrelenting hills await you. I did great on the flat part! The hills kinda killed me, but I&rsquo;m happy to report that I fought off strong urges to walk up some of the nearly vertical hills around mile 2. I gotta thank Harish for pushing me through a grueling 9 mile workout last weekend which left me on the edge of death, but gave me the confidence to keep running today! Finally, near the end of the hills, I started to feel stronger and the next thing I knew we were out of the woods and circling around the starting line where the women&rsquo;s race was getting ready to begin (had to pick it up there!). I turned the corner to the finish and started my sprint which was longer than I expected. I was about to pack it in and coast to the finish line when I saw that the clock was nearing 27. Gotta break 27, gotta break 27! Woo hoo!   This may just be some residual endorphins talking, but I&rsquo;m gonna break 20 minutes for 5K again someday.</p>

          <p>I ran the <a href="http://marinemarathon.com">Marine Corps Marathon</a> yesterday
and can now confirm that <a href="http://www.badwaterultra.com/training/bane.html">Hitting the Wall</a> is a real
phenomenon. I finished about 5 minutes faster than I did in Chicago
(2000), but I was really hoping to break 4:30. Everything was going
great through the halfway point (2:11:48 - 10:04 mpm) when a few
doubts started to creep into my head. I&rsquo;m only halfway? I gotta do
this again? Somehow I was able to make it through to mile 17 at
2:55:30 (10:19 mpm) before things really fell apart. I remember it
clearly yesterday and it seemed to be an instant replay from
Chicago. I started thinking about how much further I had to go and how
tired I already was. Then I think, well, maybe I need to rest up so I
can finish strong, huh? Maybe I should walk through the next water
break - that won&rsquo;t be such a bad thing, right? And then the next thing
I know, I&rsquo;m walking more than I&rsquo;m running. Once I start walking, I&rsquo;m
done. The key is not to think about how much further you have to go,
but rather to take it one step at a time, but that&rsquo;s obviously easier
said than done. The marathon is not a rational thing - if you think
about it and you let your rational mind make decisions for you, you&rsquo;ll
never accomplish your goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still quite happy with finishing. I&rsquo;m sore all over, but in that
satisfying kinda way. I was able to take the train home yesterday and
even made it to work today. And unlike 2000, I&rsquo;m motivated to keep
running, although I&rsquo;m going to stay away from marathoning for a
while. My left brain isn&rsquo;t ready for it.</p>
