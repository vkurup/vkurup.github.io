          <p>Steve Yegge wrote about the <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/ruby-tour">expressiveness of Ruby</a> as compared to
Java. He used this simple problem as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How about if we write a program that will print out all the words in the dictionary starting with the letter &lsquo;Q&rsquo; (case-insensitive), grouped by increasing length, and sorted alphabetically within each group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ruby version was about 12 lines of code and Java version about
43. Of course, the point of the exercise wasn&rsquo;t simply the difference
in LOCs, but in the overall simplicity of dealing with collections of
data. Still, I wanted to see how Tcl would deal with the same
problem. Here&rsquo;s the simplest version I could come up with:</p>

<p><b>Tcl functional programming (And the example in Perl)</b></p>
<p>
I don't do as much tcl programming as I used to, but I do do a lot of
Perl and some Ruby.
</p>
<p>
One thing I have really picked up from the Perl community is a love of
using functional programming when it makes sense (which is quite a
bit). If you want to get into functional programming in tcl there are
quite a few good resources on the tcl.tk wiki, but there's also a
fantastic functional tcl package in openacs that every openacs
programmer should make themselves familiar with:
</p>
<p>
<a href ="http://openacs.org/api-doc/procs-file-view?version_id=358343&path=packages/acs-tcl/tcl/ad-functional-procs.tcl">[ACS Tcl 5.2.0 : ad-functional-procs.tcl</a> - full lambda functions (with no memory leaks, although a bit of memory usage)
</p>
<p>
Now, onto the fun part! I thought I'd take on the Q word example in
Perl. Here's a reasonable way to do it in Perl:
</p>
<pre>
use strict;
open W, '/usr/share/dict/words' or die $!;
my @words = &lt;W&gt;;
chomp @words;
close W;

my $max = 0;
for my $word (sort {length $a &lt;=> length $b} sort grep { /^q/i } @words) {
    if (length $word > $max) {
        $max = length $word;
        print "Words of length $max:\n"
    }

    print "$word\n";
}
</pre>
<p>
And here's the pathological way :)
</p>
<pre>
open W, '/usr/share/dict/words';
    
length > $max ? print 'Words of length ' . (($max = length) -1) . ":\n$_" : print

for sort {length $a &lt;=&gt; length $b} sort grep { /^q/i } &lt;W&gt;;
</pre>

<p><b>More stuff to learn</b></p>
<p>
Thanks Prem for the amusing comments about languages. I still have the
"Revenge of the Nerds" on my to-read list.
</p>
<p>
Mark, that is one scary looking snippet of Perl. :) Thanks for the
links to the functional programming procs in OpenACS. I had never seen
those. Do you know of any code that uses them?
</p>
<p>
I've been meaning to learn some more about functional programming, but
the going has been difficult. It's definitely a different mindset.

          <p>This is one of the most amazing things I&rsquo;ve ever seen. An autistic man takes a 45 minute helicopter ride over Rome and recreates what he sees with near perfect accuracy on paper. <a href="http://xenmate.blogspot.com/2006/05/human-camera.html">More information about him</a></p>

<p>This guy&rsquo;s brain is structurally the same as mine, yet its capabilities make my brain seem like it&rsquo;s broken. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to think that my brain could have the same capability if it were exposed to the proper conditions. I have no idea what those conditions are, or else I&rsquo;d be able to cure autism. But seeing feats like this show me that there is so much that we don&rsquo;t know about our brains and their function. And that&rsquo;s kinda exciting.</p>

  </h1>

          <p><a href="http://kurup.org/dave/blog/2006/09/07/primary-care-medicine-perspective">Dave referenced an interesting article</a> in the NEJM titled <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/9/861">&ldquo;Primary Care &ndash; Will it Survive?&quot;</a> These two quotes summarize the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 2006 report from the Center for Studying Health System Change reveals that from 1995 to 2003, inflation-adjusted income decreased by 7.1 percent for all physicians and by 10.2 percent for primary care physicians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been estimated that it would take 10.6 hours per working day to deliver all recommended care for patients with chronic conditions, plus 7.4 hours per day to provide evidence-based preventive care, to an average panel of 2500 patients (the mean U.S. panel size is 2300).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compensation is down and responsibilities are up. I&rsquo;ve been especially aware of this as more than a few of my colleagues have left, without being replaced. So not only do we have more to do per patient, we have more total patients per doc. This will worsen as the population ages. These conditions are leading to a decrease in the number of students and residents who choose primary care, which of course creates a vicious cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/9/861/F1"><img src="http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue9/images/large/01f1.jpeg" alt="primary care over time" /></a></p>
<p>One of the interesting solutions proposed in the article was a heavier use of web-based solutions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A more thoughtful solution to physicians' time constraints requires a combination of team care and electronic encounters. Nonphysician team members working with Web- and e-mail- based patient portals can perform routine preventive care functions and manage less complex chronic care. However, forging cohesive and efficient teams is a challenge, and few payers adequately reimburse these services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in creating those types of solutions. The problem is that when you use these solutions and begin to speed up patient care, the temptation will be to increase the number of patients seen, rather than to spend more quality time with each patient. If you do that, you begin to break the doctor-patient relationship - a relationship that is more valuable than the purely technical aspects of care alone.</p>

<div class="one-comment">
<p><b>In decline, yes</b></p>
<p>
I'm not sure about dying. But conditions may have to get really bad, or more likely, a high-profile personage will have to die because of the lack of  good primary care before things change.
</p>
<p>
A recent conversation with a colleague from residency, a general
internist in private practice, revealed a high level of frustration
with policy makers who are totally disconnected from front line
realities. In large part I agree with him.
</p>
<p>
Policy makers are busy studying questions like this:
</p>
<p>
"Television Watching and Other Sedentary Behaviors in Relation to Risk of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Women" (JAMA. 2003;289:1785-1791)
</p>
<p>
in order to come to conclusions like this:
</p>
<p>
Obesity is an important problem, but please, do we need a study to
prove that watching TV doesn't help you get thinner? Next will be a
guideline that primary care docs quantify how many hours each patient
watches T.V. .....
</p>
<p>
My friend detailed regulatory changes in nursing home care that make
it harder for him to do the right thing for patients.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps another way that the internet can play a positive role in this
mess is to channel such feedback to policy makers who truly are
interested in change or to expose to the public eye frustrations
voiced by docs in private.

</p>
<p>
I laughed out loud when I read this. Because it's so true. Lately it
seems that everyone has another 'pet' project that we need to
implement. HIV screening for everyone - only takes a few
minutes. Depression screening for everyone - just a few minutes. And
it's hard to argue with it because they seem like worthwhile to do,
yet it really squeezes the time that you have with the patient.

<p><b>From a Patient's Perspective</b></p>
<p>
As a patient with chronic depression, I find dealing with primary care
physicians to be such a frustrating and humiliating experience, I
stopped going.  Every ailment I have presented to a primary care
physician has been quickly dismissed as being "all in my head," with
no real analysis of my symptoms.  Even potentially serious conditions,
such as 12 years of infertility or rectal bleeding, are dismissed as
being pychiatric in nature.  How a primary care physician can make a
determination that my symptoms are baseless, without doing blood work
or even a basic physical exam, is amazing to me.  That's why I have
totally given up going to the doctor all together.

<p>I love taking pictures with my trusty old Canon S200. It takes great pics and I get to take the credit. I&rsquo;m just horrible about getting them off my camera and onto my website. I finally uploaded a <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/?folder_id=61013">whole bunch</a> today, dating back to early May when we went to <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71973">Philadelphia for Kevin and Joanne&rsquo;s wedding</a>. The next group is from <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71975">Brooklyn and Staten Island for Mary Ann and Benjeil&rsquo;s wedding</a>. We interrupted wedding season to watch <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71979">Ethan graduate from law school</a> in Minneapolis. While in the Twin Cities, we got to spend a few minutes with <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=73510">Ajay</a>. Back home, we started <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71981">Memorial Day in the Cloisters</a>, had lunch in the city (photo above), and finished the day by meeting a cute girl named <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=73401">Amalie</a> (of Amalie &amp; Ivory fame!). A week later we were back in the Midwest for <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71983">Sivan&rsquo;s cozy high school graduation</a>. Nothing like watching your nephew graduate from high school to make you feel old. <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=74486">Mike and Susan threw a barbecue in Long Island</a> to celebrate their farewell. <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=74502">Asha</a> was there too! Next up on the wedding circuit were <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71985">Russ and Michelle</a>. They were nice enough to get married in DC, so we were able to stay with Puja and meet <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=74305">Loki</a>. <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71987">Mala interviewed in Norfolk</a> where we were introduced to <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=74063">Kylee</a> for the first time.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s not enough for you, here are some <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71977">random pics from the Bronx</a>. I&rsquo;m sad to say that I&rsquo;ve yet to take any photos of <a href="http://kurup.org/dave/photo/photo?photo_id=71894">Hunter June</a>, so I&rsquo;ll point you instead to <a href="http://kurup.org/dave/photo/album?album_id=67042">her parents' photos</a>.</p>

<p>Can you believe that it&rsquo;s been a year since <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding">we got married</a>? Me neither. For our wedding, Mike
and Ellie gave us a generous gift certificate to the bed &amp;
breakfast of our choice. It took a while to find the right one. We
started at bedandbreakfast.com and surfed dozens of listings. This
industry really needs some web consulting advice. Most B&amp;B
websites don&rsquo;t provide nearly enough information. I want more photos,
more reviews. I want to get a feel for the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We finally found a website that showed off those things and made a
reservation at <a href="http://www.eccebedandbreakfast.com/">Ecce</a>. We had
high expectations, but I&rsquo;m happy to say that they were exceeded. You
won&rsquo;t find more hospitable proprietors than Alan and Kurt. Our <a href="/images/ecce-room.jpg">room was tastefully designed</a> and was stocked
with a gourmet coffee machine, TV/DVD/VCR, fridge and jacuzzi! It was
pure luxury. The breakfasts were over the top. Definitely try the
french toast with chocolate.</p>
<p>The house sits on a bluff overlooking the Delaware River. The view is
amazing. I tried to take one of those panorama pics, but I don&rsquo;t think
it does it justice. This place must be breathtaking in the fall. We
saw 4 or 5 bald eagles and numerous hawks from the house. We also saw
a lot of deer hanging out near the highways.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Ernesto was winding through the region this weekend, so
we didn&rsquo;t do too much in the way of outdoors stuff. We did enjoy the
Harvest Festival Market and had some great fried food at the bar at
Lackawaxen House. We were less impressed with the Front Porch Cafe,
but it was very busy and had gotten good reviews, so maybe we just got
unlucky.</p>
<p>So thanks again, Mike and Ellie. I&rsquo;m certain we never would&rsquo;ve
otherwise explored this paradise just 2 hours from our front door. And
thank you Mala, for the best year of my life (so far!)</p>

<p><b>bed and breakfast blog from Puerto Rico</b></p>
<p>
I found your blog by searching for bed and breakfast blogs.
</p>
<p>
I'm having a terrible time finding more blogs written by bed and
breakfast owners like mine.
</p>
<p>
It is a <a href="http://myblog.rainforestinn.com"> bed and breakfast
blog </a> about our place deep in the heart of the El Yunque
rainforest of Puerto Rico. We are working on repairing hurricane
damage and we do a podcast about Puerto Rico

          <p>Mala finishes her fellowship in July 2007, so we&rsquo;ve entered job search mode. We&rsquo;ve got a few interviews scheduled, but it just seems harder than it should be to find out who has positions available.</p>
<p>Some criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>focus on clinical practice</li>
<li>location with a lower cost of living than NYC (I guess that rules out &hellip; NYC)</li>
<li>friendly colleagues, staff, environment</li>
<li>family friendly</li>
<li>location near friends or family</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you know of someone that needs hard-working, intelligent, caring pediatric endocrinologist, let me know. Act now and we&rsquo;ll throw in a computer-programming, marathon-running internist!</p>

          <p>One of my favorite podcasts is going on hiatus. (A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcast</a> is basically a fancy word for a radio show that you can download to your MP3 player.) <a href="http://talkinghistory.oah.org/">Talking History</a> is produced by the Organization of American Historians and because of budget problems, they cutting funding for Talking History.</p>
<p>The host Brian LeBeau is the epitome of a great interviewer. He mostly stays in the background, giving the stage to the historian, but when he asks a question, you immediately feel like it&rsquo;s a question that you would want to ask. He makes interviewing seem simple. It&rsquo;s clear that not only has he read the work of the historian he&rsquo;s interviewing, he understands the impact of their work. But most of all, the show is great because of the content. They choose great topics with great authors and historians. If you have any interest in history, go back and listen to their <a href="http://talkinghistory.oah.org/arch2006.html">shows for the past couple years</a> (which will remain up despite the hiatus). Hope the hiatus is short&hellip;</p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t forget to <a href="https://www.oah.org/giving/index.html#Anchor-11176">donate to their cause</a> if you enjoy the content as much as I do)</p>

While Talking History takes its hiatus, you might check out the
Teaching Company ( http://www.teach12.com/teach12.asp?ai=16281 ). They
scout out good teachers from universities across the US for lectures
on a variety of topics.

You're right Prem, the content looks enticing. But, it's a little on
the expensive side and I'm really a fan of the podcast format. Let the

This is awesome!  We need more of this.  Mo' podcasts, mo' podcasts,
mo' podcasts!
</p>
<p>
It's hard to find the quality stuff, though.  The free marketplace has
been inundated.  All part of the process, I know, I know (quality will
rise to the top).  It would be cool to have a site that has a good
rating system for free podcasts.  There probably already is one or
ones like it.  Haven't seen it/them, but perhaps it can be filtered,
fine tuned.

That's my problem too. Finding good stuff. There are a few sites that claim to help you (Just do a google search for 'podcast directory'), but I haven't been overwhelmed with their usefulness.

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>The duration of treatment for a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is problematic. Most patients who have one will never have another one, yet those who do have a 5% risk of death due to their recurrent DVT. We need a simple test which separates one group from the other.</p>
<p>This weeks JAMA (no link as issue is not online yet) reports on an article claiming that thrombin generation may be that test. Thrombin is one of the key factors in coagulation and the theory is that patients who generate excess amounts of thrombin are predisposed to developing blood clots. This cohort study showed that patients with peak thrombin generation below 400 nM had a 60% lower risk of developing a recurrent DVT over the course of about 5 years of follow up.</p>
<p>The limiting feature of this study is that they excluded patients with Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency and SLE. They also excluded patients with cancer, recent pregnancy, recent trauma, or recent surgery.</p>
<p>That means that before we use this test, we need to make sure that we&rsquo;ve excluded all of the above diagnoses first. That doesn&rsquo;t make it such a useful screening test. It would be useful to know is whether patients with Protein C deficiency (as an example) with low thrombin-generation values are at high risk for recurrent DVT. That is, does thrombin-generation trump Protein C deficiency, or vice versa.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like to have is a test that told me either 1) The patient is low risk or 2) The patient needs further testing. Then, I could do a simple test in all patients with DVT and only send the complicated hypercoagulable workup in patients who had a positive screening test. It seems like thrombin-generation may eventually be that test.</p>
<p>Also in this issue of the journal is a nice quote from Thoreau:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write while the heat is in you &hellip; The writer who postpones the recording of his thoughts uses an iron which has cooled to burn a hole with. He cannot inflame the minds of his audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good advice, which I need to take more often.</p>

That quote always gets credited to Thoreau instead of me. I believe I
told you two weeks ago to "blog more" which is a less flowery approach
to Thoreau's basic sentiment. He's such a snooze anyway - has anybody
really ever read all of Walden? ;)

          <p>Blair Corp, a company in my portfolio, announced second quarter earnings today. They were disappointing, but not as disappointing as reported by <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com">bizjournals</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bizj/060724/1320068.html">&ldquo;Blair Corp. swings to loss&rdquo;</a> is the title of the article. While dramatic, it&rsquo;s completely wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blair Corp., a catalog clothing retailer and direct marketer, reported a loss in the second quarter as sales fell nearly 5 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>False. They reported a profit of $233,000 in the second quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blair said its second-quarter results were negatively impacted by the sale of its credit portfolio and last August&rsquo;s stock buyback of 4.4 million shares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not true. The buyback doesn&rsquo;t affect the operating results. If anything, they made the reported results look <strong>better</strong> than they really are. The stock buyback reduced the amount of outstanding shares by about one-half, so the reported earnings-per-share (EPS) results are about twice what they would have been without the buyback.</p>
<p>None of this is to deny the fact that Blair&rsquo;s results were terrible and that the stock price has been even worse. I&rsquo;m a little appeased by the fact that web sales increased by about 18% versus last quarter. Perhaps a few smart minds will start pursing the web angle as the wave of the future!</p>
