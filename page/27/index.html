          <p>The power finally came back on at around 7:20 PM tonight. I was
sitting on my futon trying as hard as I could not to sweat, when I
heard a loud cheer from the courtyard and saw that the lights had gone
on in the apartments outside my window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a weird couple of days. The power went out around 4:15 PM
yesterday while I was looking up some labs in the preceptor&rsquo;s
room. The A/C had been on full-blast, so we all thought that it was
just an overloaded circuit, but soon we got word that nearby buildings
were affected and everyone went smoothly into disaster-mode. Take care
of any urgent patient needs and encourage everyone else to go home. No
staff leaves until we know what&rsquo;s going on. Around 6:30, we got the
word that whoever was within walking distance could go home, provided
that they be back first thing in the morning. I figured 4 miles is
walking-distance, so I left. From the 80&rsquo;s to around 63rd St, 2nd
Avenue was packed with cars trying in vain to get to the Queensboro
bridge. Traffic lights were off, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter since
the cars weren&rsquo;t moving anyway. Civilians were trying to direct
traffic with varying success. The cars obeyed, but pedestrians were on
their own schedule. From the Queensboro down to the 40&rsquo;s, pedestrians
replaced the cars and swarmed over the street.</p>
<p>I got to my neighborhood around 8ish. Most of the local shops were out
of flashlights and running low on water. I swear the people at the
counter were just making up prices as they went along, but no one
really seemed to care. After getting settled at home, I went for a
short walk outside around 10PM. I was shocked at how dark New York was
without any lights. You could clearly see the stars in the sky. It was
dangerous to walk around without a flashlight because there would be
people just sitting on the sidewalk waiting to be tripped over.</p>
<p>But everything is back to normal now and the only casualty is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime">uptime</a></p>

          <p>An article in the NY Times claims that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/science/12MAIL.html">&lsquo;6 degrees of separation&rsquo; is an exaggeration</a>. They tested it by asking people to forward emails to people that they knew in hopes that the chain would eventually lead to 1 of the researchers' destinations. I know that I delete any chain mail that I get, so I&rsquo;m not sure that the study&rsquo;s results are valid.</p>
<p>Let me provide an anecdotal rebuttal. I went to <a href="http://www.archana-subhasis.us/">Subha and Archana&rsquo;s wedding</a> in Chicago last weekend and I&rsquo;m guessing there were 400 people there. I met about 20 people whom I hadn&rsquo;t met before. Of those, 2 had links to me through people who had nothing to do with the wedding. One was a cousin of Sushil, my good buddy from Boston. The other one is a little more convoluted. My cousin Deepu was the inspiration for the name of a musical group when he was at Wash U in St. Louis. Deepu has since moved on to San Fran, so the group has changed its name. A person I met at the wedding is currently a member of that group and has always wanted to meet the infamous Deepu, whose name is plastered over the other members' instruments.</p>
<p>Now, does being connected through a band&rsquo;s name count as a degree of separation?</p>

          <p>Another interesting article in the Times today. Lo and behold, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/health/12PHYS.html">annual physical exam</a> is useless. Shocking, huh? Well, no - not really. The first <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=7030166&amp;dopt=Citation">questions about the annual physical</a> cropped up 20 years ago and recent studies have only confirmed these initial doubts.</p>
<p>So, do I perform annual physicals? Yup. Why? A few reasons&hellip;. As a relatively young doc, I think it&rsquo;s important to examine <strong>LOTS and LOTS</strong> of normal patients in order to get a firm sense of what&rsquo;s normal and what&rsquo;s abnormal. And even if I were 100% confident in my physical exam, I would still want to keep those exam skills sharp.</p>
<p>The annual physical is also a great time, if not the only time, to discuss preventive care with patients. Acute care visits are already rushed and sick patients aren&rsquo;t the most receptive listeners.</p>
<p>Patients in my community are underserved as it stands - getting rid of annual physicals would only contribute to patients getting lost in the system.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, performing annual physicals makes me look like a doctor. Patients expect annual physicals and I&rsquo;d look like a quack if I didn&rsquo;t perform them, regardless of how much science is backing me up. This is one of those classic &ldquo;Art of Medicine/Science of Medicine&rdquo; intersections. In order to be able to practice the Science of Medicine effectively, we need to compromise on the scientific purity a bit, for the sake of the Art of Medicine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I still listen to everyone&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said Dr. Stewart Rogers, an internist at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. &ldquo;Why pick that fight? Why try to explain 10 years of evidence-based medicine so the patient will understand why I didn&rsquo;t do that test? The reason to listen to hearts is that it establishes our priestly majesty when you tell them about smoke alarms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, I do try to explain to patients that not all tests are necessary and can in fact be harmful, but I&rsquo;m not dogmatic about it.</p>

          <p>It was pouring, monsoon-style here in NYC today, but I went running anyway. When it&rsquo;s raining, no one else is out, so I get the path to myself. And jumping over (or through) the puddles makes me feel like a tough guy. I swear I can hear the Rocky theme song when I run in the rain. The only bad thing about running in the rain is that the always-stunning midtown skyline gets obscured by the clouds.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t run outside since July 13th when my knee started hurting. I&rsquo;ve run on the treadmill a couple times this week and my knee felt fine, so I decided to hit the pavement today. I ran to the East River and all the way down to the South Street Seaport. About 8 miles in 90 minutes. My knee was a little sore at the end but it feels fine now.</p>

<p><b>Pains of Running</b></p>
<p>
I think my body is trying to send me a message.  Since the beginning
of this year I really began to elevate my mileage.  I started with a
5k race in the beginning of April then a 5 mile race by the end of
April and then a mini-marathon in the beginning of May.  During this
whole time period I could feel my heels and body begin to have more
aches and pains.  I took about 2 weeks off of running after all of
this and have been back into my running for the past 2 months.
Lately, I have noticed myself skipping some runs.  I find it very
frustrating.  I tell myself....are you just being a wimp!  Today I
skipped a long run.  A 12 miler.  I woke up this morning feeling very
achey(back and heels).  I am telling myself to maybe take a couple of
days off or running and instead doing some stationary bike, which
really sucks!  I have come to realize that I need to focus more and
just finishing the Marathon I am training for than trying to kill
myself for a great time.  Vinu, I feel your pain cuz!

Hey Harish! I think you have the right attitude. Just set your goal on
the finish line and I guarantee you'll be happy with your
performance. And I think I can say with some conviction that "You,
sir, are NOT a wimp!" It's good to back down on your training every
once in a while - let your energy regenerate again. Don't worry -
there's still plenty of time left!

Keep up the strong work, Rocky...er, Vinu.  I'm in the middle of 2
continuous weeks of 'nightfloat' (8p-8a shifts) which is sapping my
will to live, not to mention my ability to run.  I went for a long run
(maybe 11 miles) this past weekend, but I'm not sure I'm going to have
the heart for more than a few miles these next 1.5 weeks. Gotta keep
trying.. Really looking forward to seeing everyone again in a couple
of weeks!  Harish, hang in there.  It's no crime to take a couple of
days to rest before getting back to the training...

Just make sure it's the proper Rocky Theme, and not the Weird Al

it does sound good to have a sandwich, on "Rye or the Kaiser"  I
really should get out more.

          <p>A young guy came in as a walk-in with some mild shortness of breath on exertion and associated chest pain. He was the last patient that I saw during a long, busy day and his symptoms were very mild. I was thinking that maybe he had mild asthma or a respiratory infection, but he didn&rsquo;t look sick at all. Then I listened to his heart. A loud holosystolic murmur throughout with a fixed split S2. Wait, wait. I know this one&hellip;. (sounds of my mind clunking along) ASD - <a href="http://www.heartpoint.com/congasd.html">Atrial Septal Defect</a> (<a href="http://www.ucsfhealth.org/childrens/medical_services/heart_center/congenital/conditions/atrial/signs.html">Patient Information</a>).</p>
<p>He had his echocardiogram today which confirmed that he had a large ASD (We don&rsquo;t need no stinking echo!). He&rsquo;ll be going to Bellevue for repair and most likely will do very well. I explained everything to him (in Spanish &ldquo;un agujero in su corazón&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s times like these that make me glad that I get to do what I do.</p>

Nice pick up!  Are they going to close it percutaneously (i.e. in the
cath lab?)

<p><b>Good question</b></p>
<p>
Unfortunately, we don't have a cath lab here at Metropolitan, so all
of our cards stuff goes to Bellevue, which is kinda like a black
box. Hopefully he'll follow-up soon and with a lot of luck, he may
even come with a procedure report :-)

          <p>We went whitewater rafting in Pennsylvania in 2000, sea-kayaking in North Carolina in 2001, and <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5317">death-marching (er&hellip; hiking) in the Grand Canyon in 2002</a>. This year, we chose <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5564">kayaking and hiking in Seattle</a>.</p>
<p>We went kayaking near the <a href="http://www.guidetosanjuans.com/">San Juan Islands</a> on Thursday. It was a great upper body workout and our guide <a href="http://sea-quest-kayak.com/sea-kayaking-guides.htm">Martine</a> was a fountain of information. We saw some harbor seals close up and a bald eagle from afar. We (well some of us) were really hoping to see whales, but unfortunately, they didn&rsquo;t cooperate.</p>
<p>On Friday, we drove south to <a href="http://www.mount.rainier.national-park.com/">Mt. Rainier</a>. The skies were overcast in Seattle but they conveniently cleared up just as we neared the park. The views were breath-taking (or was that the hiking?). We trekked around Paradise (yup that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called) along a path that Manu picked out. It was challenging, but we wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. One of the climbs took us to the top of the cliff where Manu warned Noel, &ldquo;If you fall, Anita won&rsquo;t let you join us next year!&rdquo; After a quick well-deserved soak in the hotel&rsquo;s outdoor jacuzzi, we finished the night with some amazing sushi at Shiro. Everything was great but I could&rsquo;ve done without the Uni (sea urchin) - those who didn&rsquo;t eat it seemed to enjoy it the most.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, we played our annual basketball game. Because of some logistical details, I had the fortune of playing on the young-guys team in game 1 and the old-guys team in game 2. My team lost both games, thus graciously providing both the oldies and the kiddies with bragging rights. I took a few movies - <a href="http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1618.AVI">Harish making a shot</a>, <a href="http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1620.AVI">Girish with a tough shot</a>, and <a href="http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1621.AVI">Dilu with some fancy dribbling</a>.</p>
<p>After basketball, we ate brunch at the Space Needle and took in the great views of Seattle and Mt. Rainier in the background. Saturday was a day to relax and take in the city without exercising too many muscles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skipping over a lot of details, but the bottom line is that I had an amazing time. It&rsquo;s always more fun than I imagine it could ever be. I can&rsquo;t wait til next year.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://kurup.net/seattle.htm">Manu&rsquo;s site</a> for some more pictures.</p>
