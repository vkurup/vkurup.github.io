          <p>I can&rsquo;t seem to find things on the web as well as I used to. I blame <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi">Google being

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I just went down a Cory Doctorow rabbit hole. It started from a link in <a href="https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/">Austin Kleon&rsquo;s newsletter</a> to <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/">Doctorow&rsquo;s post about his blog being his version of a commonplace book or a Memex</a>. I remember Doctorow as being one of the early famous bloggers and an early crusader against unending copyright, but I haven&rsquo;t really paid much attention to him since those early days. I distinctly remember when his first book, &ldquo;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&rdquo; was released for free on the internet. I remember it being surprising because he was &ldquo;just a blogger&rdquo; and now he was writing a real book. I was intrigued by some of the ideas in it. Like the concept of Whuffie, which was a social status indicator that everyone could see floating above your head, so that you knew who was important and who was a loser. With augmented reality, this might come true sooner than we think. I actually couldn&rsquo;t initially remember the name of the book so I had to look through his <a href="https://craphound.com/shop/">book list</a> to find it, and then saw that he&rsquo;s written like 20 books now, many which look really interesting, so my to-read list just grew a bit. I also found his article about <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/">enshittification</a>, which I think is one of the best essays I&rsquo;ve seen in recent years. I&rsquo;ve heard the term a lot, but didn&rsquo;t realize that he had coined it. That article is another reason that I&rsquo;ve started to write again, here on a page that I own.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m not sure that title is an exact quote, but I thought I heard <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/arthurbrooks2/">Arthur Brooks say something like that as he was interviewed on a Peter Attia podcast</a>. At least that&rsquo;s what I took from whatever he said. His point was that the common advice to &ldquo;follow your bliss&rdquo; is misguided. When faced with choices, you shouldn&rsquo;t choose the easy thing, you should choose the hard thing. I&rsquo;m not sure that any of this is revolutionary, but that title sure is kinda surprising to me, and I think it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>What would have made me happy this evening? Certainly way low on that list is writing this blog post. As you can tell if you follow my blogging (ha!), I clearly don&rsquo;t like to write in public. The easy thing, the thing that my brain was telling me to do because it promised me happiness, was to sit down and scroll through my phone, or pick up my Kindle and read a novel, or basically do anything that was not me trying to <strong>create</strong> something. The hard thing, the thing I knew would be painful, was to scribble down this post because I know it will never be as good as the post that is in my brain. Taking this idea in my brain, which is perfect because nobody else can see it, and trying to put it on the page here&hellip; well that is scary and painful and I know people will wonder why I&rsquo;d even think this was worth thinking, let alone sharing with the world. But in the long run, doing this activity of taking ideas in my brain, and working with them on the page, especially in public is clearly going to be better for me than leaving them in my brain. It will lead to me being a happier person.</p>
<p>Doing the thing that won&rsquo;t make me happy is the key to happiness.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Today, I have a guest post for you from a <a href="/blog/2019/04/08/avik-730/">very famous author</a>.</p>
<h3 id="by-avik-kurup">By: Avik Kurup</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to visit Italy, I believe that these three tips will make you have an amazing trip.</p>
<p>First and foremost, visit Florence, Rome, Venice, and Cinque Terre. Florence has delicious food and the best gelato out of all of these places. Rome has the best pizza. Also, the colosseum and the forum are important and fun sites to see there. In Venice they have incredible pasta and seafood and many places to ride on boats.</p>
<p>Another important thing to know about visiting Italy is that you don’t want to drive. Cars are difficult to use because there are a lot of one way roads and confusing traffic lights. You will enjoy walking or going on a bike tour more. You can also use the train for longer distances.</p>
<p>The last tip that will help you enjoy your trip to Italy is you should eat as much  pizza, pasta, and gelato as possible. Pizza in Italy has a crunchier crust and they put a ton of cheese. When you order pasta the bowl is humongous, but there is a small hole in the middle that is filled with pasta. It is way more than you think. I recommend the pasta bolognese. Italian gelato is fresh and inexpensive. You can get two flavors in a cup for $2.50!</p>
<p>Clearly, Italy has fantastic sights to see and food to eat. If you follow these three tips you will have a great trip!</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>The USB-C cord kept falling out of my Android phone. It started happening in the car. A
little bump while driving would make the cord fall out. Then it started happening even
when I just had it plugged in on a table. I&rsquo;d come down in the morning and the charge
would be drained because it hadn&rsquo;t been fully plugged in. Finally, I couldn&rsquo;t even get
it to charge unless I plugged it in forcefully, and put a book under the cord at a
certain angle to keep it plugged in.</p>
<h2 id="the-googling">The googling</h2>
<p>Googling for this problem didn&rsquo;t find anything specific to my phone, but I did find
people complaining of this issue and other people telling them that this was because of
lint in the USB-C port.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nexus5x/comments/4morbk/comment/d3xaqew/">[1]</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlM0i9PUTQ">[2]</a>
<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/382427/Whats+the+best+way+to+clean+and+maintain+the+USB-C+port">[3]</a></p>
<p>I just needed to get that lint out somehow.</p>
<h2 id="what-didnt-work">What didn&rsquo;t work</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compressed air</li>
<li>A toothpick (it was too thick)</li>
<li>A plastic zip tie (It was too flimsy)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-did-work">What did work</h2>
<p>A SIM card removal tool. You know, one of those things that they send you with a new
phone to poke into the SIM card housing to get it to eject? It was the perfect size and
depth to be able to get all the way around the SIM card and get copious amounts of lint
(ewww!) out of the port. Now my USB-C cord plugs in with a satisfying click and stays
connected.</p>
<h2 id="philosophical-musings">Philosophical musings</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird that this three year old phone now feels new to me. For a while now, I would
have a little dread every time I went to plug in this phone, knowing that it would be
fiddly and that I might come down to a dead phone in the morning. Now, with this little
improvement, I feel a weird warmth towards the phone again, similar to that feeling I
had when it was a new phone. I cleaned out the lint a few weeks ago, and I still have
this warm sensation towards it. Every time I plug it in, I get a little burst of
happiness when it clicks in satisfyingly. It&rsquo;s almost as if seeing a problem with the
phone that I didn&rsquo;t think would exist, and then seeing a solution to that problem, makes
me appreciate the phone more than if it had never had that problem. That just feels
weird and revelatory to me.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I have a new <a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-edition">favorite laptop</a>. I needed
a new non-work laptop and Linux is my OS of choice. It has been for at least a decade,
but recently that favoritism has been cemented since I chose to use a Macbook Pro for
work. After 6 months with the Mac, I&rsquo;m finally starting to feel productive with it, but
it has been a painful re-learning (and un-learning) process. I still fondly return to my
Linux machines at the end of the work day. Mac OS X is just too &ldquo;in-your-face&rdquo; for me.</p>
<p>So I started planning to get another ThinkPad when I heard about
<a href="https://frame.work">frame.work</a> on Hacker News. They are a startup focused on building
functional, modular, <strong>repairable</strong> laptops which are also beautiful, light and fun to
use. Check out their &ldquo;About&rdquo; page for more about their mission, but it resonated with
me. I&rsquo;ve always loved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE">poke</a>ing around my
computers and it&rsquo;s unfortunately gotten much harder to do that with all of my electronic
devices. Frame.work is fighting against that trend.</p>







<span class="caption-wrapper ">
  <img class="caption" src="/images/frame-work-unboxed.jpg" title="Frame.work laptop contents" alt="Frame.work laptop contents">
  <span class="caption-text">Frame.work laptop contents</span>
</span>

<p>They have a DIY option where you install your own RAM, SSD and WiFi module. Even the
non-DIY option comes in with external pluggable modules so you can configure your
accessories. I got 2 USB-C ports, a USB-A port, an HDMI-port, and an SD-card reader. But
it&rsquo;s simple to pop out a module and pop in a new one. I don&rsquo;t see myself doing that too
much, but when I do need that SD card reader, I&rsquo;ll be smiling. Setting up the DIY parts was
fun and easy. Each part has a QR code on the part and on the location in the laptop
where it gets installed, which points to detailed instructions.</p>







<span class="caption-wrapper ">
  <img class="caption" src="/images/frame-work-insides.jpg" title="Frame.work laptop insides" alt="Frame.work laptop insides">
  <span class="caption-text">Frame.work laptop insides</span>
</span>

<p>Ubuntu 20.04 doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box (WiFi issues, I think?), so I installed 21.04,
and everything works except for the fingerprint reader (which never worked with Ubuntu
for me on my ThinkPad either). There are instructions to build the software needed to
get it to work, but I&rsquo;ll wait for it to get rolled into a future OS release (I&rsquo;m old).</p>
<p>Overall, the computer itself is a dream. The screen is large and bright. The keyboard is
dreamy, compared to my Thinkpad X1 Carbon. I think it&rsquo;s better than my MacBook Pro too,
but honestly that thing is too huge to use as a laptop so I always use it with an
external keyboard. The computer is light and the battery life is more than adequate for
my needs (though there are gripes and workarounds on the forums about this).</p>

  <img class="caption" src="/images/frame-work.jpg" title="Frame.work laptop" alt="Frame.work laptop">
  <span class="caption-text">Frame.work laptop</span>
</span>

<p>I thought that there would be more rough edges to the whole process, but I&rsquo;ve been
pleasantly surprised. I hope others like it as much as I do so that the company sticks
around!</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Hi loyal reader(s)! It is nearly halfway through 2021 and this is my first post of the
year. And writing on this here blog was one of my 2021 resolutions, so I guess that was
a complete failure. Although, maybe I can make up for it by actually writing more
regularly over the next few months. It has been a whirlwind of a year for just about
everyone, right? When the pandemic started, I remember making a list of the things that
I might want to blog about and the only thing I remember from that list was that I
wanted to blog about &ldquo;not wanting to blog about the pandemic&rdquo;. It was just too
exhausting to think about. And I think I still feel that way. I have written some
private thoughts about things, but I&rsquo;ll leave them under wraps.</p>
<p>The biggest change in my life is that I am starting a new job tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll be a
Software Engineer at Kevel, programming in Clojure (among other languages). I&rsquo;ve been
infatuated with Clojure (and functional programming in general) for a long time, so I am
beyond excited to be able to use it professionally. This is also the first job that I&rsquo;ll
be starting as a &ldquo;remote-only&rdquo; worker. Normally, I&rsquo;d walk into the office and introduce
myself to someone and then start to get oriented. It will be weird to do that via an
online chat of some sort. Am I showing my age?</p>
<p>What else is going on? Well I&rsquo;m not going to talk about the pandemic, but I do encourage
people to go <a href="https://aif.org/donate/covid-19-response/">help out people in India</a> (or
wherever else people need help.) We are luckily healthy and vaccinated. The kids have
survived remote schooling and two of them have returned to school partly in-person. I&rsquo;ve
been running and meditating and gardening, all with minimal success.</p>
<p>So, what is up with you all? Hope to write again before the end of the year.</p>

          <p>There&rsquo;s this cool thing called Advent of Code, described best
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/about">here</a>. I found out about it while reading my
<a href="https://cpbotha.net/2020/12/12/weekly-head-voices-211-table-mountain-run-ish/">favorite weekly weblog</a>
and so I&rsquo;ve decided to try my fledgling (maybe flailing is a better word?) Elixir skills
on it. There are 2 puzzles each day (<code>day_1_0</code> and <code>day_1_1</code> are my solutions). Here&rsquo;s

    <a href="https://vkurup.github.io/blog/2020/12/11/install-multiple-python-versions-using-pyenv/">Install multiple python versions using pyenv</a>
  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> is awesome and has changed the way that I manage
my Python environments. One tiny annoyance is that it takes a looong time to install
each Python version, which of course makes sense, since it has to download and compile
each version on your machine. But it&rsquo;s not a big deal, since you generally just do this
once and then not again until you really need to upgrade to a different Python version.</p>
<p>Recently, though, I was working on a project that uses tox to make sure that the project
runs on multiple Python versions, in this case 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9. The specific versions
were included in the <code>.python-version</code> file, which looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>3.9.0
3.8.6
3.7.9
3.6.12
</code></pre><p>I didn&rsquo;t have all of these installed, so rather than doing <code>pyenv install 3.9.0</code> and
then waiting a few minutes, and then repeating the process for each version, I wrote up
this little script, which I named <code>pyinstall.sh</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#719e07">#!/bin/bash
</span><span style="color:#719e07"></span><span style="color:#586e75"># Install all versions specified in .python-version</span>
<span style="color:#b58900">set</span> -ex

<span style="color:#719e07">while</span> <span style="color:#b58900">read</span> version; <span style="color:#719e07">do</span>
    pyenv install -s <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;</span><span style="color:#268bd2">$version</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;</span>
<span style="color:#719e07">done</span> &lt;.python-version
</code></pre></div><p>Since <code>pyenv</code> is nice enough to include the <code>-s</code> flag which means &ldquo;skip if already
installed&rdquo;, this can be run as many times as you want and it will only install the
version if it&rsquo;s not already installed</p>
