  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I set up an OBi110 device to provide a landline at home. OK, it&rsquo;s not a land line, it&rsquo;s
a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) line, but it performs a similar function. We&rsquo;ve
always had a landline. Our cell phone coverage is spotty at times and ever since Mala
started working from home, she needs to have a reliable phone line for her global
conference calls.</p>
<p>The problem is that Spectrum was charging us $44.95 per month plus taxes, which took it
near $50 every month. I considered a few options including:</p>
<ul>
<li>MagicJack</li>
<li>Ooma</li>
<li>I looked at a few others&hellip; can&rsquo;t remember them all</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I settled on buying an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_telephone_adapter">ATA device</a> and then connecting it
to a cheaper VOIP service. I chose <a href="https://voip.ms">voip.ms</a> which has been great so
far.</p>
<p>One Time Costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2EivFuP">OBi110</a> ATA device: $19.90</li>
<li>voip.ms setup fee: $0.40</li>
<li>voip.ms e911 setup fee: $1.50</li>
</ul>
<p>Monthly Costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>voip.ms fee for an incoming phone number: $0.85</li>
<li>voip.ms e911 monthly fee: $1.50</li>
</ul>
<p>Per-Minute Costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>voip.ms incoming: $0.009 per minute</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on my monthly per-minute costs because there is an unlimited
plan that is $4.25 per month, which I&rsquo;ll switch to if I use more than that per month. In
any case, this is MUCH cheaper than Spectrum.</p>
<p>Now, if you do any research about the OBi110 device, you&rsquo;ll see everyone telling you not
to buy it because it is out of service and doesn&rsquo;t support Google Voice. This is true,
ObiTalk doesn&rsquo;t support the device anymore. When it was supported by the company, you
could just dial a special code on your phone and it would do all the set up for you.
Since it&rsquo;s not supported, that procedure doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. But you can <a href="https://wiki.voip.ms/article/OBi_100/110_%26_OBi_200">manually configure the device</a> with the
excellent docs from voip.ms, and for a geek like me that was not bad. And yes, you can&rsquo;t
link a Google Voice number to the device, but I didn&rsquo;t want to do that anyway. I think
if you wanted to keep using a google voice number, you could probably get pretty close
by putting a different number on your device (through voip.ms) and then pointing Google
Voice at that number. Incoming calls would work fine in that way, but I&rsquo;m not sure about
outgoing calls. If you want to seamlessly use Google Voice on an ATA device, then OBi110
isn&rsquo;t for you. You&rsquo;ll need the OBI202 (which was out of stock when I was looking).</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I worked on adding tests to some Django forms today and I was reminded that Django forms
operate in two <em>modes</em>. I think of them as the GET mode and the POST mode. The GET mode
displays the form and the POST mode processes the data that you supply to the form. I
don&rsquo;t know why, but I often forget that. Instead, I sometimes treat them as a normal
Python class, especially when I&rsquo;m creating automated tests for them. I instantiate
the class (<code>form = MyForm()</code>) and then just call any of its methods and make sure they
return the right values or achieve the correct side effects. The form that I was working
with today had a couple features. The first was that it provided some helper functions
to the template so that the template could display the form properly. Those are in the
GET mode. So I did something like:</p>
<pre><code>user = create_my_special_user()
form = MyForm(user=user)
self.assertTrue(form.is_user_special())
</code></pre><p>And that worked as I expected. The second feature of my custom form was that it cleaned
the data in a particular way. So I did:</p>
<pre><code>form = MyForm(user=user)
cleaned_data = form.clean()
self.assertEqual(cleaned_data, expected_data)
</code></pre><p>Instead of passing, the test blew up:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'MyForm' object has no attribute 'cleaned_data'
</code></pre><p>Why? Because the <code>clean()</code> method is called when you provide it with POST data
(normally&hellip; there are also other ways to populate forms). If you don&rsquo;t supply it data,
then <code>cleaned_data</code> doesn&rsquo;t get populated. The answer is to provide data to the form:</p>
<pre><code>form = MyForm(user=user, data={})
cleaned_data = form.clean()
self.assertEqual(cleaned_data, expected_data)
</code></pre><p>And that works as expected. The reminder to myself is to always identify which mode of
the form you are testing, GET or POST.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>At school, Kavi is reading
<a href="https://amzn.to/2PctnQm">&ldquo;We have always lived in the castle&rdquo;</a>, by Shirley Jackson. I
read her short story,
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/06/26/the-lottery">&ldquo;The Lottery&rdquo;</a>, in high school. I
recall the main plot of the story, but I&rsquo;m sure I have forgotten many details.
What I <strong>haven&rsquo;t</strong> forgotten is the sense of shock I felt as the plot finally became
clear. As I&rsquo;m typing this, I wonder if that was more because I was young and new to
being shocked, or whether it was really shocking. In any case, that feeling of being
shocked by that story is deeply embedded inside me.</p>
<p>So I checked this book from the library and finished it today. It was dark and
disturbing, reminiscent of &ldquo;The Lottery&rdquo;. There were many elements of foreshadowing.
From the start, you wonder what Mary Katherine or her family did to sow such discontent
among the villagers, and the answer comes slowly, in bits and pieces. I wondered why
they had library books that they would never be able to return. In the end, I was sucked
in and couldn&rsquo;t put the book down until I figured it all out. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s a short
book.</p>
<p>Some random thoughts that my brain generated while reading this book (and that I&rsquo;d
prefer to remember someday):</p>
<ul>
<li>When Merrikat and Connie first enter their house after it was trashed by the village,
Merrikat is not surprised that the library books are intact because it&rsquo;s against the law
to damage library property. I smiled.</li>
<li>The absurdity of Merrikat&rsquo;s behavior at times struck me hard. The first time was when
she threw a glass pitcher on the floor because she was upset by a visitor talking to her
sister too much. I had to re-read that section a few times because it was written in an
almost off-hand way, as if this was normal behavior. She continues to behave like that
in bursts, and then the more absurd part becomes Connie&rsquo;s calm reaction to these
behaviors. Piece by piece, you get to understand more about how disturbed they are, and
why.</li>
<li>Merrikat&rsquo;s belief in magical powers that keep her safe are both hard to believe and
comforting. I kept waiting for someone to say one of her three magic words, as if that
was the only way that anything could go wrong.</li>
<li>I wanted Charles to be taught a lesson. I guess it happened, but a part of me wanted
it to be more dramatic and more crushing. I&rsquo;m a sucker for an evil character doing
clearly evil things and then getting caught red-handed and punished. I know that&rsquo;s
simplistic, but I still like it and am a little disappointed when I don&rsquo;t get that
satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love the fact that I&rsquo;m finding books to enjoy, thanks to my kids. Life is good.</p>

          <p>I just finished <a href="https://amzn.to/35FoTXV">Open Borders</a>, a graphic novel about immigration policy.
(Not 2 things that normally occupy the same sentence)</p>
<p>It was an excellent presentation of a position that I&rsquo;ve always felt to be morally correct, in my
heart of hearts. I am one of the few lucky ones who gets to be an American citizen just because of
the fact that my parents took it on themselves to forge a better life for us. Why shouldn&rsquo;t everyone
have this opportunity? This book shatters many of the myths that allowing open borders makes things
&ldquo;worse&rdquo; in any way for natives.</p>

          <p>Whenever I come across a book that I want to read, I add it to my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3158304-vinod-kurup">Goodreads</a> to-read list. This list,
of course, is always growing. I&rsquo;m very slowly coming to terms with the fact that I will never make
it through this list and that someday I will die, with unread books on my to-read list. Horrors! The
other major problem with this simple approach to a reading list is that I can never remember why I
added a book to my list. If it was a recent addition, I might recall, but in most cases I just can&rsquo;t
remember why I wanted to read the book in the first place.</p>
<p>In that way, the book Deep Survival made it to my to-read list last year, and I picked it up for my
Kindle when it went on sale recently:</p>

  <span class="caption-text">Knocking off a to-read</span>
</span>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten through the first few chapters so far. I have been enjoying it, but something about it
is bothering me. It felt very <em>familiar</em>. Maybe that is what happened&hellip; I read a teaser for the book in
a magazine article or something, and that is why I added it to my to-read list last year.</p>
<p>And then yesterday, while I was converting the blog from Octopress to Hugo, I had to fix up some
posts, so I ended up looking through a bunch of my old posts, including&hellip;. <a href="/blog/2007/04/15/deep-survival/">my book review of Deep Survival</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird feeling to read a review about a book that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to read for over a year,
written by a 12 year younger version of yourself.</p>

          <p>Kavi was looking over my shoulder as I tried to get my blog working in a local Docker container.
I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point that the site seems to be up and running in the container, but I can&rsquo;t seem
to get to it from my laptop. So, he wondered why I was putting port 1313 in my URL bar
(&ldquo;localhost:1313&rdquo;) and then I showed the results of <code>netstat -ant</code> to prove that something should be
listening on that port. And we got the IP address for google.com and then put that in Chrome&rsquo;s URL
bar with <code>:80</code> at the end of it, and magically, it worked. (Other websites did not work, and I
explained that most sites will not allow their sites to be accessed via IP address).</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t figured out why I can&rsquo;t access the blog running in my container, but I think Kavi&rsquo;s
learning more about networking than I ever did (and I&rsquo;m hoping that he&rsquo;ll be able to debug these
issues for me&hellip; soon enough)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>UPDATE: I figured it out. Hugo&rsquo;s server was listening on localhost inside the container, when it
needed to be listening on 0.0.0.0. Adding that as a <code>--bind</code> parameter fixed the issue (though I had
to also add <code>--baseURL</code> and <code>--appendPort=false</code> params, which saddened me.)</p>

          <p>I moved my blog from Octopress to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> today. I had been <a href="https://kurup.org/blog/2014/07/22/pygments-on-arch-linux/">slightly unhappy with Octopress for a while now</a>, but
mainly I just wanted something new to play with. Hugo is MUCH faster than Octopress was:</p>

<p>But I still liked the style and theme of my old site, so I was happy to find that <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-octopress/">someone had already built an Octopress theme for Hugo</a>. I promptly
stole his work and customized a few things here and there to make it look (nearly) exactly like my
old site did. Yay! Thanks to <a href="https://parsiya.net/">Parsia</a> for building that theme. I&rsquo;ve also
subscribed to his RSS feed because his site looks pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Moving my content wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it wasn&rsquo;t hard. I mainly just copied the old markdown posts over,
changed the front matter, and then fixed a few octopress plugins I was using to work with Hugo.</p>
<p>Future steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch from Disqus to something self-hosted</li>
<li>Generate the HTML on the server rather than having the HTML in git</li>
<li>Update my About page and Computers page</li>
<li>&hellip; oh, maybe write more!</li>

Slurps one last sip from his small cup.</p>
<p>Then bounding from the kitchen table,<br>
Fast as lighting, he is able</p>

He yells to Mom, &ldquo;It was delicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big brother also has no idea.<br>

The smile confirms he&rsquo;s over the moon.</p>
<p>The source of this happiness, on his arm,<br>
His brand new watch, and a 7:30 alarm.</p>
<p>(A real-life story, barely embellished)</p>

          <p>When we made our 2018 goals last year, Kavi, Anika and I all had some running-related goals. I don&rsquo;t
remember offhand exactly what each of our goals were, but I think we all wanted to run more races,
because well, races are fun! I somehow stumbled on the
<a href="http://www.precisionrace.com/triangle-race-series2/">Triangle Race Series</a>. It&rsquo;s a series of a couple dozen races
throughout the year around the Triangle, so we signed up for a few. They keep standings based on
participation and placement. You get 5 points for running a race, and more if you place in your
age/gender division. We ran about 4 or 5 of the races. I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about the series at
all recently since I injured my right Achilles in July and haven&rsquo;t run at all since then. Getting
old really is a bummer. Anyways, I checked the website today and they have posted the
<a href="http://www.precisionrace.com/s/Series_Rank_Report_Race25_Cash_v9_2Races-xzxt.pdf">final 2018 results</a>. I got
6th place in my &ldquo;not-quite-old-fogey&rdquo; division! Not bad, huh? Yeah, I know&hellip; it&rsquo;s mostly a
participation award, but still, I&rsquo;m proud. But wait! That&rsquo;s not even the best part. I&rsquo;m even more
proud of Kavi and Anika. They are both in the 0-19 age group, so get to compete against teenagers.
Kavi got 3rd place in the male 0-19 division, and Anika got 1st place in the female 0-19 division!</p>

  </h1>

          <p>I got 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/2zE10T1">Nest E thermostats</a> because Duke Energy was having a sale around
Black Friday. I didn&rsquo;t have any strong motivation to have a Nest. The idea of a smart home is cool,
but most &lsquo;smart&rsquo; things nowadays have ended up being more work than benefit. Anyway, for $75 each, I
thought it was worth a try. We have 2 thermostats so I decided to install the upstairs thermostat
first. The process started off smooth and easy. I like that they provide a back plate, which I
didn&rsquo;t even notice until my trusty assistant, Kavi, pointed it out. My existing Honeywell thermostat
is rectangular and if I just put the small circular Nest in its place, there would be a big chunk of
unpainted real estate on the wall. Having the back plate prevented this from being a &lsquo;replace
thermostat, and learn how to patch and paint the wall&rsquo; project. The online
<a href="https://nest.com/support/article/How-to-tell-if-your-heating-and-cooling-system-will-work-with-the-Nest-Thermostat#works/?mode=guide">Nest compatibility checker</a>
and the paper instruction manual (which includes stickers to label the existing wires) are also nice
touches. That all gave me the (misguided?) confidence that even I could do this. A study confidence
which lasted until I flipped the circuit breaker back on and &hellip;. nothing happened. According to the
manual, the Nest was supposed to turn on, say Hi, and then walk me through the set up process. But
it remained dead as a doorknob. I pulled it off the wall and plugged it in via USB (a nice
troubleshooting feauture). It turned on and then when I placed it back on the wall, it complained
that it was not getting enough power from the R wire. The error code was E195. When I looked at the
&lsquo;Technical Info&rsquo;, it reported that the R wire was only providing 2-3 volts, while it needed 24. I
chatted up Nest support, which took about 30 minutes to connect on a Friday night. The
representative was responsive and useful. They eventually recommended trying to disconnect the C
(common) wire. For a reason I still can&rsquo;t explain, this brought the voltage on the R wire from 2-3
volts up to 35 volts, and my Nest was working.</p>
<p>Having tasted the sweet nectar of success, I then tried to swap my second Nest in for my downstairs
thermostat. I made a huge mistake here. It had been easy to identify the circuit breaker for my
upstairs furnance because it was labelled, &ldquo;Up Furnace&rdquo;. But there was nothing labelling the
downstairs furnace. I switched off the circuit breaker that I thought was responsible for the
downstairs HVAC, but in hindsight, I think I got the wrong one (and since it was warm out and the
heater wasn&rsquo;t running, I didn&rsquo;t notice because nothing was running in the first place). Anyway, I
walked through the rest of the instructions and again got to the point where the Nest was supposed
to power on, but it didn&rsquo;t. So I powered it on via USB and placed it back on the wall.
Unfortunately, this time I was getting only 0.01 volts from the R line. Still, I was hoping that the
&lsquo;disconnect the C wire&rsquo; trick would work again. Unfortunately, disconnecting the C wire did nothing.
I walked through things with Customer Service chat. Again, they were helpful (rather than just
spouting cookbook-type basic info), but in the end, they didn&rsquo;t have a recommendation that would fix
things. They suggested that I get a voltmeter and test the voltage output at the various wires. I do
not have a voltmeter and felt that I was getting in over my head, so instead I put in some calls to
HVAC service companies, but since it was the weekend and this wasn&rsquo;t urgent, I was resigned to
having no heat over the weekend. I watched a few Youtube videos of HVAC repairs, some of which were
quite entertaining. Eventually, I tried to reconnect my old Honeywell thermostat and was surprised
and intrigued when this ALSO failed. It made me think that I messed something up somehow. The only
thing I could think of was that since I hit the wrong circuit breaker, there was live current in the
wires. While moving them from the Honeywell to the Nest, perhaps I touched 2 wires together causing
the system to short circuit. I don&rsquo;t remember noticing a spark or anything, but that was my best
guess. I eventually watched enough videos to give myself confidence that I could open up the HVAC
and find the electrical panel. I did that successfully (after turning off the CORRECT circuit
breaker, and also pulling out the pull out switch next to the furnace). After cleaning out a ton of
cobwebs, I found the LED light on the electrical panel was off (even after connecting the circuits
temporarily). I searched the panel and found a 3-amp E fuse (like the kind I&rsquo;ve seen in automobile
fuseboxes). I pulled it out and sure enough, it was blown. It looked like the &lsquo;bad fuse&rsquo; in this
<a href="https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/how-to-check-fuses-by-rocco-lovetere">photo</a>. Off to Home
Depot, I purchased 2 replacements for 3 dollars, and then replaced the busted fuse with the new one.
I flipped the circuit breaker and put the pull-in switch back in. The first encouraging sign was
that the red LED light on the electrical panel turned on. I went inside and, joy of joys, the Nest
was booting up and showed 35V via the R wire. So, I guess the bottom line is that I need to be more
careful when I&rsquo;m at the circuit breaker box.</p>
